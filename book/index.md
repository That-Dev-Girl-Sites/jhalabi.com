## About _Sweet Little You_

In this tender affirmation, the story’s new mother pens a love letter to her baby of how her child came to be and how she cherishes their little family of two. A precious and rhyming text shares the mother’s promise to help them dream, explore, and find adventure in life.

> Two pieces are needed to help create you. <br>
> I had only one, so now what should I do?

Evocative of beloved classics such as _Guess How Much I Love You_, _Pat the Bunny_, and _Love You Forever_ yet with a contemporary and diverse variation, _Sweet Little You_ is for all of the intentional single parents who haven’t seen their own type of chosen family represented in a picture book that they can share with their child. The poignant story’s stirring and loving message is perfect as an affirming everyday read-aloud and also as a thoughtful and heartfelt gift for special occasions and milestones such as baby showers, new baby, birthdays, Mother’s Day, and Valentine’s Day.

      Sweet Little You is an adorable children's book that showcases a different type of family. It's written in an easy to read way, but is also a good way to open conversation with young readers about how some families don't always look the same as others. It's also a wonderful story that will resonate with all mothers, but especially single moms. The illustrations are lovely and really bring the story to life, and I think, overall, it's a story young readers will enjoy and want to talk about, regardless of how they came to be. This is a book I would highly recommend to all parents. 5 stars!

      This is a sweet love story from a single mother to her child.  I love books that explain to children why things are different.  Probably less of an issue these days with so many different family types, but still a loving way to explain their family of two.  With beautiful illustrations and the perfect colors, it was a joy to look at the pictures as I read the story, which to be honest is what a little one will be doing.

      Creating a story about a child's origins for a very young picture book audience may feel like a stretch, but Joni Halabi's focus on a loving mother's enthusiasm about her child's potential and growth drives the information, which is provided in a gentle way that emphasizes this acceptance and love over the circumstances of the child's conception.

## _Sweet Little You:_ An origin story

I am a single-mother-by-choice to a donor-conceived child. I am very open with my daughter about her origin story, because I want her to feel confident about our family structure.

We read every day and have a lot of books at home. I love our book collection, but I struggled to find a book that felt authentic to our family. Books explaining the process of sperm donation and single-parent families felt too clinical for a toddler. She just didn’t “get” them. Our “welcome baby” books were full of plural pronouns, typical of a 2-parent household. Those books are beautiful, but also inauthentic to our family.

This was the catalyst for my book. My book is a poem for babies and toddlers born to a single parent. It is a welcome from their parent, introducing their family structure and (very basically) where they came from.

I want this book to be a story where my daughter and I can see ourselves in the book. Feeling seen, especially when you are a part of something relatively “atypical”, is so important.  Additionally, and just as importantly, I want this book to be an introduction to a baby about their family structure in such a way that they will never remember a “big reveal” about their family or how they came to be.
