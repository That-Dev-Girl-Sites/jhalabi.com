<h2><em>Sweet Little You:</em> An origin story</h2>
<p>I am a single-mother-by-choice to a donor-conceived child. I am very open with my daughter about her origin story, because I want her to feel confident about our family structure.</p>
<p>We read every day and have a lot of books at home. I love our book collection, but I struggled to find a book that felt authentic to our family. Books explaining the process of sperm donation and single-parent families felt too clinical for a toddler. She just didn’t “get” them. Our “welcome baby” books were full of plural pronouns, typical of a 2-parent household. Those books are beautiful, but also inauthentic to our family.</p>
<p>This was the catalyst for my book. My book is a poem for babies and toddlers born to a single parent. It is a welcome from their parent, introducing their family structure and (very basically) where they came from.</p>
<p>I want this book to be a story where my daughter and I can see ourselves in the book. Feeling seen, especially when you are a part of something relatively “atypical”, is so important.  Additionally, and just as importantly, I want this book to be an introduction to a baby about their family structure in such a way that they will never remember a “big reveal” about their family or how they came to be.</p>

<p><em>Sweet Little You</em> is an adorable children's book that showcases a different type of family. It's written in an easy to read way, but is also a good way to open conversation with young readers about how some families don't always look the same as others. [...] This is a book I would highly recommend to all parents. 5 stars!</p>
