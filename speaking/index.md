I have had the pleasure to present and teach at a number of conferences and classrooms. I love speaking to both present and future developers about a variety of front-end development topics. A list of my previous speaking dates and presentations are below.

## See What I Mean?: Data Visualization in WordPress

Data visualizations are graphical representations of large and small datasets. Usually, they are charts or graphs that make patterns in these datasets easier to understand. This developer-focused talk demonstrates how to use Google Sheets and SVGs to create a custom Gutenberg block that will display data in a responsive and accessible way.

## Customizing Gutenberg: Lessons Learned at Georgetown

The new Gutenberg editor comes with so many great content blocks. However, what if your editors have special use cases for their content that cannot be easily created with Gutenberg’s out-of-the-box blocks? At Georgetown, we have created a series of custom Gutenberg blocks in an effort to address our editors’ unique content needs.

<section markdown="1" class="has-background copper" aria-label="Accessible Web Development">

## Accessible Web Development

We develop websites for everyone to use, so why not make sure that everyone is able to use our sites? We as developers need to plan for accessibility before we write our first line of code.
