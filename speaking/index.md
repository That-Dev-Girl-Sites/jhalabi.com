I have had the pleasure to speak and teach at a number of conferences, meetups, and classrooms. I love speaking to both present and future developers about a variety of front-end development topics. A list of both my upcoming and previous speaking dates and presentations are below.

## Make it your own!: Integrating Twig templates with your WordPress block theme

WordPress block themes offer a great amount of flexibility for site creators. However, what if your site (or network of sites) needs to offer the flexibility of a block theme and also adhere to a strict set of design requirements? 

This is the situation that we at Georgetown University found ourselves in. Our Web Services team manages over 350 sites across the university. These sites need both content flexibility and adherence to visual identity guidelines. To that end, we created an external pattern library. This library controls the markup and design of global elements using Twig templates and atomic design patterns. It is designed for use in both WordPress and static sites.

This talk is a case study that demonstrates our WordPress block theme. We will discuss the structure of a traditional block theme and how our implementation works with external pattern library templates.

## Presto Chango: The magic of block transforms

WordPress block transforms provide content editors with an easy way to migrate content from one block to another. The core editor already includes many transforms from one core block to another. Turn a paragraph block into a heading. Turn an image block into a cover. 

But, did you know that you can up your post editor game by writing your own transforms? Turn a core block into your own custom block! Give your content editors the ability to easily switch between two blocks and create custom shortcuts that will automatically populate a custom block.

## Gutenberg Developer Hours

This new meetup series from the [WordPress Social Learning Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-social-learning/) invites attendees to ask a panel of WordPress developers about the block, plugins, theme development, or any other WordPress editor topic. I am very excited to have been asked to be a part of the panels for 2 of the 4 inaugural sessions.

## Dynamic Blocks FTW!: Customize Gutenberg Without Living in Fear of Validation Errors

Picture this: You write a brand new custom Gutenberg block. Sometime later, you realize that you need to change your block’s markup to either fix a bug or add a new feature. Suddenly, the editor crashes your block. Validation error!  You can fix this with a deprecation object. Or… could there be a better way?

Enter the dynamic block. In this workshop, you will learn about the difference between dynamic and static blocks, how block validation works, and how to write a dynamic block. You will never have to write a deprecation again!

<section markdown="1" class="has-background timberwolf" aria-label="Data Visualization in WordPress">

## See What I Mean?: Data Visualization in WordPress

Data visualizations are graphical representations of large and small datasets. Usually, they are charts or graphs that make patterns in these datasets easier to understand. This developer-focused talk demonstrates how to use Google Sheets and SVGs to create a custom Gutenberg block that will display data in a responsive and accessible way.

## Customizing Gutenberg: Lessons Learned at Georgetown

The new Gutenberg editor comes with so many great content blocks. However, what if your editors have special use cases for their content that cannot be easily created with Gutenberg’s out-of-the-box blocks? At Georgetown, we have created a series of custom Gutenberg blocks in an effort to address our editors’ unique content needs.

## Accessible Web Development

We develop websites for everyone to use, so why not make sure that everyone is able to use our sites? We as developers need to plan for accessibility before we write our first line of code.
