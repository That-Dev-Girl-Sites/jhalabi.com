title: Reading List
---

Because... you know... books are awesome!

I like to read books. A lot of books. I also like to keep track of what I have readâ€¦ partially so that I can refer to them later and partially because I will forget that I have read something before. All of the books that I have read (since 2010, at least) are listed here.

I feel the need to apologize for 2020. And 2021. And... also 2022. I could blame a lot of things, but it simply boils down to pure exhaustion. Apparently, pandemic + raising a toddler/pre-schooler + publishing a book + _(oh right)_ my actual full-time job that pays me was too much and something had to give. That being said, I did read and am still reading a huge amount of picture books and kid lit. (Having a preschooler helps with that!) One day, I will log all of those books, but that day is not today. Perhaps when I have more free time. You know, like when my kid is 20.

**Daisy Jones & The Six** <br> Taylor Jenkins Reid | I am a bit ashamed to admit this, but I did not realize this band was fictional until about half-way through the book. I am clearly not up on my 1970s rock bands. I'll just say that this is how engaging and real-seeming all the characters were. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | May
**The Bell Jar** <br> _Sylvia Plath_ | Inspired to read this after my previous read and I loved it. It definitely took at turn half-way through that I should have expected, but did not. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | May 
**The Last Confessions of Sylvia P.** <br> _Lee Kravetz_ | Finally got back to reading and I chose a doozie! I don't know much about Plath's work (and this has inspired me to _finally_ read _The Bell Jar_), but this book was certainly captivating. No spoilers here, but I have some feels about the ending. I get it, but... feels. Still worth the read. | April
**Stuff You Should Know: An Incomplete Compendium of Mostly Interesting Things** <br> _Josh Clark & Chuck Bryant_ | This book is interesting, informative, and funny, just like the SYSK podcast, except, you know, in book form. There were even many (many) parts of the book where I could hear Josh or Chuck's voice as I was reading. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | January

**We Are Not Like Them** <br> _Christine Pride & Jo Piazza_ | I am still processing my feelings about this one. I read it in a day. Scratch that. An _evening_. I never binge-read because, frankly, I do not have the time or energy, but this book captivated me. An important must-read. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**Fortunately, The Milk** <br> _Neil Gaiman_ | A super quick YA read by my favorite author. It's silly, quirky, and so much fun to read. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**Cosmic Blackout! (Galaxy Zack #16)** <br> _Ray O'Ryan_ | It has definitely been a rough couple of years for reading, so I eased myself back in with a YA. This was a fun one! | February

**The Perks of Being a Wallflower** <br> _Stephen Chbosky_ | Hey books! It's been a while. Again. Honestly, the only reason I have time to read anything recreationally now is because my 3 year old won't sleep alone and I can't fall asleep at 8pm, so I lie down on her floor and read under a blanket. Reminiscent of my teen years, to be honest. Regardless, this book was captivating, relatable, and done in 3 days. (Well, nights.) <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August

**Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.** <br> _Judy Blume_ | Hey 2020. This is embarrassing, but it's been almost a year since I've read a grown up book. I decided to start with an "easy" one. Loved it. I wish I read it sooner. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | December
**Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup** <br> _John Carreyrou_ | This book made me so angry, but I could not put it down. Definitely worth the read if you have any interest in startup culture, healthcare, and what not to do. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | January

**Version Control** <br> _Dexter Palmer_ | I did not really engage with this book until the second half. After that, I was compellingly curious. I feel like the book was a little too soap-opera-ish at times (too many characters), but I really enjoyed how it all came together. | October
**The Immortalists** <br> _Chloe Benjamin_ | Back to fiction. This story was about a family and a bunch of predictions. I was more interested in some family members than others. And I have so many questions. | September
**Becoming** <br> _Michelle Obama_ | Continuing with the autobiography streak. Love, love, love this book. Michelle Obama's life is amazing and her writing is beautiful. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | September
**Neil Patrick Harris: Choose Your Own Autobiography** <br> _Neil Patrick Harris_ | I have not read a choose your own adventure book since I was a kid. This was a delight. Definitely the most fun I've ever had reading an autobiography. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**Clara's War** <br> _Clara Kramer_ | I have no idea where I picked up this book, but I could not put it down. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo** <br> _Taylor Jenkins Reid_ | Book club may be the only reason I find books. My first novel in a while. I could not put it down - I just wanted to keep going at the end of each (very short) chapter. Definitely not for babies. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**Dreams From My Father** <br> _Barack Obama_ | This book took a while to read, but it was worth it. Great book about race, family, and finding yourself. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**Bridge to Terabithia** <br> _Katherine Paterson_ | I am not sure how I missed reading this book growing up. It made me cry. It's been a while since a book made me cry. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | June
**Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life** <br> _Amy Krouse Rosenthal_ | Yup. It's been a while. #kids This book was a great dive back into reading a whole book because it is such short snippets at a time. Great bedtime reading. | June
**Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg** <br> _Irin Carmon & Shana Knizhnik_ | Thank you to my book club for finally motivating me into reading again. I actually read this out loud to my baby (after her books, that is) at night (and this put her to sleep). But, it did not put _me_ to sleep. RBG is truly amazing! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | March

**Fahrenheit 451** <br> _Ray Bradbury_ | Finally read this classic. Another book club book. | October
**Cloud Atlas** <br> _David Mitchell_ | Nested stories that are all connected to each other. Very clever. I read this book because of the movie trailer. _(I have not seen the movie yet. I am a terrible movie watcher.)_ | September
**Accessibility for Everyone** <br> _Laura Kalbag_ | Great, well rounded overview of web accessibility from all perspectives, from design to development to testing. Much of it was review for me because I've also been doing a ton of work in this field, but I also learned a lot from this book. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | September
**The Last American Vampire** <br> _Seth Grahame-Smith_ | The sequel to _Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter_, which I read _years_ ago. I loved that book, but this book was even better. It goes through American history, but in a world where vampires not only exist, but are a critical part of history. So well written. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**Einstein's Dreams** <br> _Alan Lightman_ | A bunch of stories of fictional worlds that follow the theory of parallel universes. Loved some; others not so much. | August
**The Nanny Connie Way** <br> _Connie Simpson_ | My first parenting book. I'm sure it won't be my last. There is some great advice in this book, but it is mixed in with a lot of self-promotional text. I skipped past the testimonials, straight to the good stuff. | July
**32 Yolks: From My Mother's Table to Working the Line** <br> _Eric Ripert_ | Another book club book (after a long book club hiatus.) I had a lot of feelings while reading this book. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | June
**Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue** <br> _Ryan Holiday_ | Interesting read about the Gawker / Hogan case, through the lens of conspiracies in general. There is also a lot of content about conspiracies throughout history that is not particularly relevant to this case, but this book definitely makes you think about power, free speech, privacy, and the state of our legal system. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | June
**Never Have Your Dog Stuffed** <br> _Alan Alda_ | I love biographies and Alan Alda is amazing. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | April
**The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy** <br> _Vicki Iovine_ | Several friends recommended this book to me after I announced my pregnancy. Great advice about all aspects of pregnancy - and way more interesting to read than typical pregnancy books. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | January

---- | ---- | ----
**Prisoner of Trebekistan: A Decade in Jeopardy!** <br> _Bob Harris_ | I love Jeopardy and this book was both insightful and hilarious.  Loved it!	<span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | December
**Go Set a Watchman** <br> _Harper Lee_ | I was debating myself about whether to read this or not. I don't remember much of To Kill a Mockingbird, but that did not matter too much.  Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | November
**When We Were Animals** <br> _Joshua Gaylord_ | A very compelling and haunting coming-of-age story about a teenage girl, told by her adult self. I'm still processing this one. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> |	November
**The Sleeper and the Spindle** <br> _Neil Gaiman_ | Short and cute, but to be honest, not my favorite. Then again, I might be over the whole fairy tale thing. | October
**Boys** <br> _Scott Semegran_ | Don't be fooled by the title. Girls can read this book too. Loved it. Loved it!	<span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | October
**After Alice** <br> _Gregory Maguire_ | To be honest, this book was very hard to follow, but then again, so is "Alice in Wonderland". I wanted to spend some more time with some of the characters, but overall, I enjoyed it. | October
**The Price of Salt** <br> _Patricia Highsmith_ | Loved this book. I don't remember when or why I picked it up, but I felt the main character's life so much. Loved it!	<span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | October
**On Beauty** <br> _Zadie Smith_ | I'm undecided on how I feel about this book. It's a very well-written story that drops you into the life of an academic family. However, I only truly liked one of the characters. | September
**Lord of the Flies** <br> _William Golding_ | Yet another book club book that I somehow never read as a child. I didn't hate it. The character development was very compelling but the ending annoyed me. | August
**The Man Who Could Be King** <br> _John Ripin Miller_ | To be honest, a little slow at the beginning, but towards the end it was very compelling. The events are all fact, but sadly, the narrator is fictional. (I really wanted him to be real.) | August
**Neverwhere** <br> _Neil Gaiman_ | Another book I read forever ago. It was definitely time for a re-read since I am seeing a theater production of it in a month. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**American Gods** <br> _Neil Gaiman_ | I originally read this book forever ago, but I figured it was time for a re-read. Love. This. Book. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**The City of Towers (Eberron: The Dreaming Dark Book 1)** <br> _Keith Baker_ | I started playing D&D again after a very (very!) long time and this book was suggested to me. No regrets. | July
**The Truth About the Harry Quebert Affair** <br> _Joel Dicker_ | Another book club book! I normally do not read mysteries, but once I got into this one, I literally could not put the book down. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | June
**Dead Trees Give No Shelter** <br> _Wil Wheaton_ | Quick read. Mildly freaky read. So good. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | May
**Animal Farm** <br> _George Orwell_ | Re-read this book for my book club. Very interesting reading it after 1984. There are some interesting parallels between the two books. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | May
**The Kassa Gambit** <br> _M.C. Planck_ | Another sci-fi book! The sci-fi and political aspects of the book were great; the romance parts were less great. There's a reason I don't read romance novels.	| May
**A Darkling Sea** <br> _James L. Cambias_ | It was nice to stretch my sci-fi reading muscles with this one! Great book about alien life, conflict, and research. Loved the fact that the alien life was not humanoid, for a change.	| April
**The Blind Contessa's New Machine** <br> _Carey Wallace_ | I keep reading books about relationships. Very quick read. Good story. I plead the fifth on my feelings about the ending.	| April
**The Handmaid's Tale** <br> _Margaret Atwood_ | This month's book club book! I was angry the entire time I was reading it. Very much worth the read, but I am ready for a less dystopian book now. Loved it!	<span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | March
**The Signature of All Things** <br> _Elizabeth Gilbert_ | And the staying single theme continues! Very compelling book, despite all the biology. (Not my favorite science.) Both Henry's and Alma's lives were fascinating to the point where I did not want to put this book down. | March
**Spinster: Making a Life of One's Own** <br> _Kate Bolick_ | Interesting take on staying single... or rather women staying true to their personal ideals. I wish I was more familiar with the poets she references in the book. | March
**Nineteen Eighty-Four** <br> _George Orwell_ | Rereading this book. Not just because of the current state of affairs and certainly not because everyone else is... but because my bookclub is. Scary, but worth it. | February
**How To Make Sense Of Any Mess** <br> _Abby Covert_ | Very basic book on information architecture. Great for beginners. | February
**The Gemini Effect** <br> _Chuck Grossart_ | Creepy, messed up, and really compelling. | January

---- | ---- | ----
**Pathfinder** <br> _Orson Scott Card_ | Possibly more compelling - and definitely more confusing - than "Ender's Game". Didn't realize it was a series at first.  Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | November
**Miramont's Ghost** <br> _Elizabeth Hall_ | Very quick and compelling read, but this book made me really angry. Undecided if that is a good or bad thing. | November
**A Walk in the Woods** <br> _Bill Bryson_ | A book about the author and his friend hiking the Appalachian Trail. Fun, but opinionated read. While "Wild" made me want to start hiking, this book kind of makes me want to stop. Not sure what that says about the book or me. | October
**The Last Woman Standing** <br> _Thelma Adams_ | Very engaging story about the life of Josephine Marcus, the woman who married Wyatt Earp. | October
**Snow Flower and the Secret Fan** <br> _Lisa See_ | Beautiful story, but hard to read at times.  I actually almost put this book down early on because of one particular chapter (reading about foot binding is clearly not for me), but really glad I finished this one. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | October
**The Wise Man's Fear** <br> _Patrick Rothfuss_ | Finally finished book 2! Arguably better than book 1. Really, really (really) can't wait until book 3. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | September
**You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures** <br> _Kyle Simpson_ | I finally understand closures!  You have no idea what a big deal this is to me (unless you are also a JS developer). Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | September
**Bossypants** <br> _Tina Fey_ | Another book from my bookclub. Seriously funny and talks about just about everything. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**Ready Player One** <br> _Ernest Cline_ | Literally the best geeky, gamer, 1980s-nostalgia book I have read.  Ever. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS** <br> _Jonathan Snook_ | Reading this for work, actually.  The specifics in the book are quite dated, but the overall theory is really great. | August
**Modern Romance** <br> _Aziz Ansari and Eric Klinenberg_ | Book from my book club.  Great insight into how dating has changed over the past few generations.  I am not sure if I prefer the old or the new paradigm. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | June
**Kitchen Confidential** <br> _Anthony Bourdain_ | Finally got back into reading after a very chaotic few months.  Interesting (and very opinionated) read about the restaurant business and food in general. | May
**The Name of the Wind** <br> _Patrick Rothfuss_ | My friends have been trying to get me into Patrick Rothfuss for years now.  They finally succeeded.  So good. Starting the next book in 3... 2... 1.... Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | January

---- | ---- | ----
**You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost)** <br> _Felicia Day_ | So, so good.  To be honest, I knew very little about Felicia Day but saw this book in the store and it just spoke to me.  And it's still talking. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | December
**Never Let Me Go** <br> _Kazuo Ishiguro_ | Creepy.  Wonderful.  Disturbing.  This is a book about a dystopian alternate reality.  I don't have a better description than that, but it was a really good read. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | December
**The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time** <br> _Mark Haddon_ | Fantastically written story about a teenager who thinks a bit differently. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | November
**The Circle** <br> _Dave Eggers_ | Well... that was creepy.  This book is very well written, engaging, and hits a little too close to home (at least on the social media and life online fronts).  Totally worth the read. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | November
**Me Talk Pretty One Day** <br> _David Sedaris_ | Fun read.  Personally, I identified more with the first half of the book but definitely enjoyed the whole book. | October
**Zoe's Tale** <br> _John Scalzi_ | Really quick, captivating read, set in the Old Man's War universe. | October
**The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao** <br> _Junot Diaz_ | I completely identified with Oscar, or at least him in his youth and the awkward unpopularity of being a teenage geek.  I know that's not the primary focus of the book, but it kind of is anyway. | October
**Start Something That Matters** <br> _Blake Mycoskie_ | I love (love!) the idea of combining business and giving.  I already knew that TOMS combines the two as their business model, but reading about the specifics and its impact was huge.  Definitely a must read - if you are an entrepreneur or not. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | September
**The Casual Vacancy** <br> _J. K. Rowling_ | I was really undecided this book in the beginning, but the characters really grew on me in the end.  These folks are seriously quirky (and sometimes horrible), but in a fascinating way. | September
**The Devil in the White City** <br> _Erik Larson_ | This book was fabulous.  The art and construction behind the World's Fair was interesting enough, but coupling that with such a dark parallel story made this book fascinating. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**The Einstein Prophecy** <br> _Robert Masello_ | Interesting fantasy / horror book. | July
**Samarkand** <br> _Amin Maalouf_ | I am usually not one for historical novels, but I was really intrigued by the first part of the book that focused on Omar Khayyam's life and the Rubaiyat.  I suppose I am staying true to my preferences for books that focus on people, rather than events. | July
**The Woman In Black** <br> _Susan Hill_ | Creepy.  Good, but creepy.  Good quick read if you like ghost stories. | June
**The Mermaid's Sister** <br> _Carrie Anne Noble_ | Just another story about a girl (who might be a stork), her sister (who is very definitely a mermaid), and a boy (who... it's complicated). | May
**Wild** <br> _Cheryl Strayed_ | Love, love, love this book.  I envy her journey, her courage, and her strength.  I picked up this book because I have been craving a change in my life and an idea to figure out what it should be. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | May
**Helen of Sparta** <br> _Amalia Carosella_ | A really intriguing and realistic-feeling book about Helen before she was Helen of Troy.  (It helps that I am fascinated by ancient Greece.) Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | April
**Rework** <br> _Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson_ | This book is from 37 Signals. A great source of not-so-traditional, but completely practical business advice. As a newly minted manager, I really appreciated it. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | March
**The Graveyard Book** <br> _Neil Gaiman_ | I don't know why, but I was not expecting this to be a children's book. However, it is Neil Gaiman, so it was awesome. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | March
**Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street** <br> _Michael Davis_ | I loved Sesame Street growing up. That show taught me to read. Seriously. Reading about its beginning - the characters, the actors, the CTW - was utterly fascinating. Loved it. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | February
**October Sky** <br> _Homer H. Hickam_ | I watched the movie forever ago, before I knew the book existed. Loved the book - both the historical and scientific parts. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | January
**The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells** <br> _Andrew Sean Greer_ | This one is about exploring yourself and how you would live your life if you had been born in a different era. The geek in me has some issues with the time travel aspects of the book, but overall, this was a fabulous book. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | January
**Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children** <br> _Ransom Riggs_ | Someone recommended this book to me a while ago. I can't believe it took me so long to read it. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | January
**The Ocean at the End of the Lane** <br> _Neil Gaiman_ | I love Neil Gaiman. This is a great fantasy novel about immortals and other worlds. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | January
**Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience** <br> _Jeff Gothelf_ | Yes. Yes. Yes. Just yes. If you are in UX, you should read this now. | January
**Someone** <br> _Alice McDermott_ | I love stories about people. This reads like a biography (sort of), but it is fiction. I really enjoyed it. | January

## Books Read in 2014 {#books-2014}

<p class="book-count">(Total: 21)</p>

Book | Thoughts | Date Read
---- | ---- | ----
**The Awkward Human Survival Guide** <br> _Adam Dachis & Erica Elson_ | I got this book somewhat randomly and decided to finally read it because I really am the definition of awkward. | December
**Dragonfly in Amber** <br> _Diana Gabaldon_ | It's about time I read another book, right? I started this one in October, but I have been busy and it was long. Like, seriously long. Good book, but I enjoyed book 1 more. | December
**Once A Runner** <br> _John L. Parker, Jr._ | I have been doing quite a bit more running lately, so I decided to read a book about competitive running. Holy. Cow. Runners are crazy. | September
**Blue Willow** <br> _Doris Gates_ | Yes, this is a kid's chapter book. I read it in about an hour. Another story about family and home. Very different from the last book I read. | September
**Take This Man** <br> _Brando Skyhorse_ | This book is a great memoir about the author's search for family, in a very philosophical sense. There is a large cast of characters here, which at times was a little confusing, but worth the read if you can keep everyone straight. | September
**Learning Responsive Web Design** <br> _Clarissa Peterson_ | I know quite a bit about responsive design already, so most of this book was a review. However, there were some key points that I did learn more about. Great book for a beginner to RWD. | September
**Life of Pi** <br> _Yann Martel_ | I do not mean to be cliche, but this one is definitely a modern classic. Slow start, but loved it once I was hooked. The end left me with lots of thoughts.... Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**The Book Thief** <br> _Markus Zusak_ | Oh my goodness! This book was so good. But so sad. But so good. I just finished it and I have no words. But I want all the words. Just read this. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**The Long Earth** <br> _Terry Pratchett & Stephen Baxter_ | Parallel worlds, a soul transplanted in a machine, alternate societies. What's not to like. Nothing! Except the ending. The ending made me angry. But this book is still totally worth reading. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**Stardust** <br> _Neil Gaiman_ | I am clearly on a Neil Gaiman kick. This is a fantasy and a love story. And I don't mean in the 50 Shades way. This is so much better. | July
**Smoke and Mirrors** <br> _Neil Gaiman_ | Well that was different. I very rarely read short stories, but I do love Neil Gaiman. | July
**Team Geek** <br> _Brian W. Fitzpatrick, Ben Collins-Sussman_ | Good book about working as a team in a software development environment, how to deal with other people, and how to lead other people. Also applies to non-geek jobs, but definitely more geared towards geeks like me. | July
**Outlander** <br> _Diana Gabaldon_ | Several friends recommended this series and I finally got around to reading the first book. Oh my goodness. So much love for this book. I need book 2 now. Like, immediately. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | June
**The Light Between Oceans** <br> _M. L. Stedman_ | A book has not captivated me like this in a really long time. I love and kind of hate the story - or at least what happened to some of the characters. That's all I'm saying. Definitely a must-read. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | May
**Javascript: The Good Parts** <br> _Douglas Crockford_ | I work with Javascript every day, so I pretty much just skimmed this book. Really good review of lots of JS concepts. Most was review. Parts were new... which was awesome. This would be really useful for beginners. | May
**The Astronaut Wives Club** <br> _Lily Koppel_ | Life sort of got in the way reading this book, but it really is a good one. Great look at the lives of the wives of the astronauts through the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | April
**100 Diagrams That Changed The World** <br> _Scott Christianson_ | Really fantastic overview of major diagrams, drawings, and inventions from cave paintings to the iPod. I skimmed through some parts and was fascinated by others. | February
**Smashing Book #3 1/3: Redesign the Web, The Extension** <br> _Smashing Magazine_ | A series of essays about website redesigns. I found the essays about information architecture and the Smashing redesign (to a responsive site) the most interesting. | February
**11/22/63** <br> _Stephen King_ | I vowed a long time ago to not read Stephen King again because his books kind of creep me out. This one is completely different. Yes, it is 800 pages long, but it is completely captivating. Though perhaps a little frustrating too, depending on your views on time travel. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | January
**Old Man's War** <br> _John Scalzi_ | Classic sci-fi novel that was recommended to me by way too many friends. Totally worth it. This book is a fascinating story about second chances. Loved it!	<span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | January
**Aria** <br> _Nassim Assefi_ | This book broke my heart. That is all. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | January

Book | Thoughts | Date Read
---- | ---- | ----
**The Design of Everyday Things** <br> _Donald A. Norman_ | Yes, again. I re-read this book for book club. | December
**And The Mountains Echoed** <br> _Khaled Hosseini_ | This book tells an incredible story about a family. The story itself jumps around enough that I think I need to reread it - mostly because I kept picking up and putting down the book over the course of this month. But definitely worth the read. I cried. In a good way (if that's a thing). Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | November
**How to Be an Adult** <br> _Nerissa Nields_ | I am a Nields fan, which is how I heard about this book. I am not exactly her target audience (i.e. my 20s were a while ago), but I did gain a lot of insights from this book. Definitely a good read for this not-quite-20-something who doesn't always feel like an adult. | October
**The Other Typist** <br> _Suzanne Rindell_ | This was a very fun book, for varying definitions of the word "fun". I will not give anything away, but I definitely had different impressions of the book between the first chapter and the last. Very good read. It helps that the 1920s completely fascinate me. | October
**A Game of Thrones** <br> _George R. R. Martin_ | The first book is almost word for word season one of the show, which was amazing. I usually read books before seeing their TV / movie counterpart, but this was an exception. Love both the show and book. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | September
**Interviewing Users: How to Uncover Compelling Insights** <br> _Steve Portigal_ | This is a very insightful book filled with advice on conducting any sort of user or consumer interview. This is something that I feel I should be doing at work, but am often too knee-deep in code. Looking forward to trying out his advice! | August
**No Frills Magento Layout** <br> _Alan Storm_ | Yes, I know. Another tech book. I have been reading (and re-reading) this book to prepare for the Magento Front-End Developer Certification exam at the end of the month. Incredibly helpful book. Wish me luck! | July
**JSTL in Action** <br> _Shawn Bayern_ | I have been using JSTL for a while now at work. This book offers a really great summary of the most commonly used tags and includes practical examples. Much of this book was a review, but I still learned quite a number of useful tips and tricks. | July
**The Woman Upstairs** <br> _Claire Messud_ | A much lighter read after that last book, but not exactly a "light" read. I totally get Nora. | June
**Team of Rivals** <br> _Doris Kearns Goodwin_ | It actually took me two months to read this book. This book is incredibly dense, but it is an amazing and well-written chronicle of Lincoln's political career. I have been a life-long Lincoln fan (really!); this was well worth the read. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | June
**The Calligrapher's Daughter** <br> _Eugenia Kim_ | This book was fascinating and frustrating all at the same time - fascinating because Korea is very much in the news now; frustrating because I was hoping for so much more for the main character. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | April
**The Impeachment of Abraham Lincoln** <br> _Stephen L. Carter_ | This was a really interesting "what-if" book about how Lincoln would have fared if he had survived the assassination attempt. A bit law-ish for me, but completely fascinating. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | March
**Granny Torrelli Makes Soup** <br> _Sharon Creech_ | An In2Books pen-pal book and my first for this school year. (Our schedule is a little off.) Great story about friendship. | March
**The Phantom Tollbooth** <br> _Norton Juster_ | Really cute, pun-filled children's novel that was recommended to me by a friend. | March
**Developing Backbone.js Applications** <br> _Addy Osmani_ | Great introductory reference for Backbone.js. I am still a newbie to it. It is a difficult read as a book, but has lots of great examples. Definitely need to re-read this one, preferably while developing something. | February
**1984** <br> _George Orwell_ | Another book in my quest to read the classics I missed. Not how I expected that to turn out. | February
**The Sandalwood Tree** <br> _Elle Newmark_ | Beautiful story about 2 families in India - one in the mid-19th century and one in the mid-20th. | January
**Holidays on Ice** <br> _David Sedaris_ | Yes, I read a holiday book after the holidays. That is weird. The book was weird. But good weird. | January
**Learning Javascript Design Patterns** <br> _Addy Osmani_ | After a 1 month + reading hiatus, I started off the new year with a tech book. Why not? This book was hard to read as a narrative, but will be a fantastic resource. | January

---- | ---- | ----
**The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks** <br> _Rebecca Skloot_ | The story of Henrietta Lacks and her cells is incredible and unbelievable. Just read this. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | November
**The Marriage Plot** <br> _Jeffrey Eugenides_ | This was a cute story and a fun read, but nothing special. | November
**The Happiness Project** <br> _Gretchen Rubin_ | This book is about how one relatively happy woman spent one year trying to become happier using a very systematic, organized approach. An approach I can relate to. Some great ideas in here. | November
**Smashing Book #3: Redesign the Web** <br> _Smashing Magazine_ | This book is a must-read if you are a web developer... or if you work with web developers. Eleven articles by eleven authors covering all aspects of a modern redesign, with lots of great tips! Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | November
**The Sandcastle Girls** <br> _Chris Bohjalian_ | This is an incredible historical love story about a world I really know nothing about. It is beautiful and a little heart-breaking. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | October
**How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe** <br> _Charles Yu_ | This book was a riot. Part philosophical; part funny; part sad. Fairly plausible science fiction physics. | October
**Brave New World** <br> _Aldous Huxley_ | Yes, I just read this book; somehow I missed reading this in school. Fantastic and fascinating book, but it really freaked me out. | October
**Mobile First** <br> _Luke Wroblewski_ | Read this for our UX book club at work. This book has a lot of good ideas about designing for mobile devices and sparked some great discussions in our group. | October
**Coraline** <br> _Neil Gaiman and Dave Mckean_ | OK, I know this is supposed to be a children's book, but it was so creepy! Really good story, though. | September
**Responsive Web Design** <br> _Ethan Marcotte_ | Read this for our UX book club at work. A great starter book for developers starting to work with responsive websites. Not a complete how-to, but has some great advice. | September
**Sarah's Key** <br> _Tatiana de Rosnay_ | This book was just heart-breaking. I could not put it down, actually. Just read it. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | August
**Just a Geek** <br> _Wil Wheaton_ | I liked Wil Wheaton before reading this, but I like him more now. A great look into his life after (and during, in a way) Star Trek. Would love to read a follow-up. | July
**The Long Run** <br> _Mishka Shubaly_ | It amazes me how someone can go from being so messed up to fit enough for ultra-running. What a journey. | July
**2084: An Oral History of the Great Warming** <br> _James Powell_ | Global warming is real, people. I do not think this because of this book, but I think this book illustrates a very real possibility for our future. Very scary. | June
**The Passage** <br> _Justin Cronin_ | This book was amazing. Long, but amazing. It is a combination of a sci-fi, vampire, and post-apocalyptic genre; it is nothing like I have ever read before. | June
**Shift** <br> _Tim Kring & Dale Peck_ | This book reminds me of "Heroes" (go figure).  I do love those kinds of TV shows, but I'm not loving that genre as a book. | May
**InterWorld** <br> _Neil Gaiman_ | While I do love Neil Gaiman, this one was not quite my favorite. Still really good, though. I mean, what's not to like about traveling across multiple parallel universes? | April
**Shatnerquake** <br> _Jeff Burk_ | I do not usually read fan fiction, but I heard about this book and I do love William Shatner. That being said... very strange. Entertaining, but strange. | April
**Plants Bite Back!** <br> _Richard Platt_ | An In2Books pen-pal book for the fables unit. | March
**Mockingjay** <br> _Suzanne Collins_ | Book 3. Better than book 2. Not as great as book 1, but really good. I want to say something about the end here, but I wont. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | March
**Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?** <br> _Philip K. Dick_ | It's "Bladerunner", at least in voice and premise, but not quite. Crazy futuristic world; worth the read. | February
**Steve Jobs** <br> _Walter Isaacson_ | A very honest book about a fascinating man. A must-read for Apple fans (and non-fans for that matter). Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | February
**Catching Fire** <br> _Suzanne Collins_ | Book 2... almost as good as book 1. So many twists and turns... I need book 3 to come in now! Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span> | February
**The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs** <br> _Jon Scieszka_ | An In2Books  pen-pal book for the fables unit. | February
**Comfort Food** <br> _Kate Jacobs_ | A good read, but kind of predictable. I liked "Friday Night Knitting Club" better. | January
**The Paris Wife** <br> _Paula McLain_ | Hemingway got around... I had no idea. This is fiction, but based on fact and a great read. | January

**Diary of a Mad Fat Girl** <br> _Stephanie McAfee_ | Another super quick read. And yes, quite mad. | June
**Declaring Spinsterhood** <br> _Jamie Lynn Braziel_ | Super quick read. Declaring spinsterhood almost sounds like a fabulous idea. | June
