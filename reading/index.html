  <h1>Reading List</h1>

  <section markdown="1" class="reading-intro" aria-label="Introduction">
<p>I love books. Most of my childhood was spent inside a book <em>(or three)</em>. Today, my house has books in <em>(almost)</em> every room.</p>
<p>I keep track of the books I have read – mostly as a reference list because my memory fails me every now and then.</p>
<p>You may notice a downturn in the numbers of books read over the last few years. I am only logged the grown-up books I read here. Our family bedtime routine includes reading one <em>(or sometimes two)</em> kid-friendly books. One day, I will log all of those books too, but that day is not today.</p>
<p>In the meantime, enjoy my list below.</p>

<td><strong>Em</strong> <br> Kim Thúy</td>
<td>Not the genre I normally read, this book was recommended to me by virtue of my new status as a student. I am taking a class at GU and this book was selected for this year's <a href='https://library.georgetown.edu/marino'>Marino workshop</a>. A fast, but powerful and emotional read. Definitely recommend, regardless of your favorite genre.</td>
<td><span class='fa fa-heart'></span> August</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Truth</strong> <br> Terry Pratchett</td>
<td>Quite accidentally, this was my first read from the Discworld series. It was a strange and wild ride and, while I wished I had started with book 1, I really enjoyed it.</td>
<td>August</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Foster</strong> <br> Claire Keegan</td>
<td>Not long enough to be a book-book, but too long to be a short story. Told from the point of view (and vocabulary) of the child main character, this story was captivating from the first page. Apparently, there is also a movie.</td>
<td><span class='fa fa-heart'></span> June</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Delta-V</strong> <br> Daniel Suarez</td>
<td>Quick read. Love space. Hate capitalism. Great book.</td>
<td>May</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Seveneves</strong> <br> Neal Stephenson</td>
<td>Another wild ride of a book. Of its 800+ pages, it took roughly 200 pages for me to be fully engaged with the story. But once that happened, I could not put the book down. Loved it. Even my 6 year old took notice and asked for updates. (She got the watered down version.) Definitely not for 6 year olds, but highly recommend for grown-ups.</td>
<td><span class='fa fa-heart'></span> May</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism</strong> <br> Sarah Wynn-Willams</td>
<td>This book was a wild ride of personal stories that illustrate the cesspool of what being a woman in tech can be. I have been pretty lucky in my experiences, but that is not true of everyone. I am thankful I never worked for &quot;big tech&quot;. Highly recommended reading.</td>
<td><span class='fa fa-heart'></span> May</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>ADHD is Awesome: A Guide to (Mostly) Thriving with ADHD</strong> <br> Penn Holderness &amp; Kim Holderness</td>
<td>I finally finished reading a book! You have no idea how hard that was. This book was more helpful than I could have imagined.</td>
<td><span class='fa fa-heart'></span> March</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Memory Librarian</strong> <br> Janelle Monáe</td>
<td>I loved this universe (as much as you can love a universe you find repellant) and enjoyed just about all of the stories. I don't normally go for short stories, so that was a delightful surprise.</td>
<td><span class='fa fa-heart'></span> March</td>

<td><strong>The Midnight Library</strong> <br> Matt Haig</td>
<td>I liked the overall story, but the pace ebbed and flowed. Without spoilers, I actually got bored in the middle, but kept reading because I wanted to know how this story would end. The ending was satisfying, maddening, and depressing. I had a lot of feels with this one.</td>
<td>October</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Agent to the Stars</strong> <br> John Scalzi</td>
<td>This was a great, quick, and highly amusing read. Parts of the book stylistically reminded me of Neil Gaiman (which is always a plus in my book)</td>
<td>September</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow</strong> <br> Gabrielle Zevin</td>
<td>I am not a gamer. I have no idea how I ended up putting this book on my library request list, but I am glad I did. I had some issues with the book (that I will not go into here because spoilers), but despite that, I did not want to put the book down.</td>
<td>August</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Before the Coffee Gets Cold</strong> <br> Toshikazu Kawaguchi, Geoffrey Trousselot <em>(Translator)</em></td>
<td>This was such a capitvating story. I had a bit of a slow start with it. There were so many characters and I had a hard time figuring out how they all related to each other. But the end was worth it.</td>
<td><span class='fa fa-heart'></span> August</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Stella Díaz Never Gives Up</strong> <br> Angela Dominguez</td>
<td>I originally borrowed this book from the library to read to my daughter, but she became disinterested half-way through. <em>(Perhaps a chapter book on ocean conservation is a bit too much for 5 year-olds?)</em> I finished it on my own and it was great. Maybe we'll try again in a year or two.</td>
<td>August</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Daisy Jones &amp; The Six</strong> <br> Taylor Jenkins Reid</td>
<td>I am a bit ashamed to admit this, but I did not realize this band was fictional until about half-way through the book. I am clearly not up on my 1970s rock bands. I'll just say that this is how engaging and real-seeming all the characters were. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>
<td>May</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Bell Jar</strong> <br> <em>Sylvia Plath</em></td>
<td>Inspired to read this after my previous read and I loved it. It definitely took at turn half-way through that I should have expected, but did not. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>
<td>May</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Last Confessions of Sylvia P.</strong> <br> <em>Lee Kravetz</em></td>
<td>Finally got back to reading and I chose a doozie! I don't know much about Plath's work (and this has inspired me to <em>finally</em> read <em>The Bell Jar</em>), but this book was certainly captivating. No spoilers here, but I have some feels about the ending. I get it, but... feels. Still worth the read.</td>
<td>April</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Stuff You Should Know: An Incomplete Compendium of Mostly Interesting Things</strong> <br> <em>Josh Clark &amp; Chuck Bryant</em></td>
<td>This book is interesting, informative, and funny, just like the SYSK podcast, except, you know, in book form. There were even many (many) parts of the book where I could hear Josh or Chuck's voice as I was reading. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>

Honestly, the only reason I have time to read anything recreationally now is because my 3 year old won't sleep alone and I can't fall asleep at 8pm, so I lie down on her floor and read under a blanket. Reminiscent of my teen years, to be honest. Regardless, this book was captivating, relatable, and done in 3 days. (Well, nights.) <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>

<td><strong>Neil Patrick Harris: Choose Your Own Autobiography</strong> <br> <em>Neil Patrick Harris</em></td>

<td>August</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Bridge to Terabithia</strong> <br> <em>Katherine Paterson</em></td>

<td><strong>Encyclopedia of an Ordinary Life</strong> <br> <em>Amy Krouse Rosenthal</em></td>

<td><strong>Notorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg</strong> <br> <em>Irin Carmon &amp; Shana Knizhnik</em></td>
<td>Thank you to my book club for finally motivating me into reading again. I actually read this out loud to my baby (after her books, that is) at night (and this put her to sleep). But, it did not put <em>me</em> to sleep. RBG is truly amazing! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Accessibility for Everyone</strong> <br> <em>Laura Kalbag</em></td>
<td>Great, well rounded overview of web accessibility from all perspectives, from design to development to testing. Much of it was review for me because I've also been doing a ton of work in this field, but I also learned a lot from this book. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>The Last American Vampire</strong> <br> <em>Seth Grahame-Smith</em></td>
<td>The sequel to <em>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</em>, which I read <em>years</em> ago. I loved that book, but this book was even better. It goes through American history, but in a world where vampires not only exist, but are a critical part of history. So well written. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>

<td><strong>The Nanny Connie Way</strong> <br> <em>Connie Simpson</em></td>
<td>My first parenting book. I'm sure it won't be my last. There is some great advice in this book, but it is mixed in with a lot of self-promotional text. I skipped past the testimonials, straight to the good stuff.</td>
<td>July</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>32 Yolks: From My Mother's Table to Working the Line</strong> <br> <em>Eric Ripert</em></td>

<td>June</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Conspiracy: Peter Thiel, Hulk Hogan, Gawker, and the Anatomy of Intrigue</strong> <br> <em>Ryan Holiday</em></td>
<td>Interesting read about the Gawker / Hogan case, through the lens of conspiracies in general. There is also a lot of content about conspiracies throughout history that is not particularly relevant to this case, but this book definitely makes you think about power, free speech, privacy, and the state of our legal system. <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>

<td><strong>On Beauty</strong> <br> <em>Zadie Smith</em></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>The Man Who Could Be King</strong> <br> <em>John Ripin Miller</em></td>

<td>May</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Kassa Gambit</strong> <br> <em>M.C. Planck</em></td>
<td>Another sci-fi book! The sci-fi and political aspects of the book were great; the romance parts were less great. There's a reason I don't read romance novels.</td>
<td>May</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>A Darkling Sea</strong> <br> <em>James L. Cambias</em></td>
<td>It was nice to stretch my sci-fi reading muscles with this one! Great book about alien life, conflict, and research. Loved the fact that the alien life was not humanoid, for a change.</td>

<td><strong>The Handmaid's Tale</strong> <br> <em>Margaret Atwood</em></td>

<td>March</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Signature of All Things</strong> <br> <em>Elizabeth Gilbert</em></td>
<td>And the staying single theme continues! Very compelling book, despite all the biology. (Not my favorite science.) Both Henry's and Alma's lives were fascinating to the point where I did not want to put this book down.</td>
<td>March</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Spinster: Making a Life of One's Own</strong> <br> <em>Kate Bolick</em></td>
<td>Interesting take on staying single... or rather women staying true to their personal ideals. I wish I was more familiar with the poets she references in the book.</td>
<td>March</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Nineteen Eighty-Four</strong> <br> <em>George Orwell</em></td>
<td>Rereading this book. Not just because of the current state of affairs and certainly not because everyone else is... but because my bookclub is. Scary, but worth it.</td>
<td>February</td>
</tr>

<td><strong>How To Make Sense Of Any Mess</strong> <br> <em>Abby Covert</em></td>

<td><strong>Pathfinder</strong> <br> <em>Orson Scott Card</em></td>
<td>Possibly more compelling - and definitely more confusing - than &quot;Ender's Game&quot;. Didn't realize it was a series at first.  Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>
<td>November</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Miramont's Ghost</strong> <br> <em>Elizabeth Hall</em></td>
<td>Very quick and compelling read, but this book made me really angry. Undecided if that is a good or bad thing.</td>
<td>November</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>A Walk in the Woods</strong> <br> <em>Bill Bryson</em></td>
<td>A book about the author and his friend hiking the Appalachian Trail. Fun, but opinionated read. While &quot;Wild&quot; made me want to start hiking, this book kind of makes me want to stop. Not sure what that says about the book or me.</td>
<td>October</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Last Woman Standing</strong> <br> <em>Thelma Adams</em></td>
<td>Very engaging story about the life of Josephine Marcus, the woman who married Wyatt Earp.</td>
<td>October</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Snow Flower and the Secret Fan</strong> <br> <em>Lisa See</em></td>
<td>Beautiful story, but hard to read at times.  I actually almost put this book down early on because of one particular chapter (reading about foot binding is clearly not for me), but really glad I finished this one. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>
<td>October</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Wise Man's Fear</strong> <br> <em>Patrick Rothfuss</em></td>

<td><strong>You Don't Know JS: Scope &amp; Closures</strong> <br> <em>Kyle Simpson</em></td>

<td>August</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Modern Romance</strong> <br> <em>Aziz Ansari and Eric Klinenberg</em></td>
<td>Book from my book club.  Great insight into how dating has changed over the past few generations.  I am not sure if I prefer the old or the new paradigm. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>
<td>June</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Kitchen Confidential</strong> <br> <em>Anthony Bourdain</em></td>
<td>Finally got back into reading after a very chaotic few months.  Interesting (and very opinionated) read about the restaurant business and food in general.</td>

<td>December</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Never Let Me Go</strong> <br> <em>Kazuo Ishiguro</em></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Circle</strong> <br> <em>Dave Eggers</em></td>
<td>Well... that was creepy.  This book is very well written, engaging, and hits a little too close to home (at least on the social media and life online fronts).  Totally worth the read. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Start Something That Matters</strong> <br> <em>Blake Mycoskie</em></td>
<td>I love (love!) the idea of combining business and giving.  I already knew that TOMS combines the two as their business model, but reading about the specifics and its impact was huge.  Definitely a must read - if you are an entrepreneur or not. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>

<td><strong>Samarkand</strong> <br> <em>Amin Maalouf</em></td>
<td>I am usually not one for historical novels, but I was really intrigued by the first part of the book that focused on Omar Khayyam's life and the Rubaiyat.  I suppose I am staying true to my preferences for books that focus on people, rather than events.</td>

<td>April</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Rework</strong> <br> <em>Jason Fried &amp; David Heinemeier Hansson</em></td>

<td>March</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Graveyard Book</strong> <br> <em>Neil Gaiman</em></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street</strong> <br> <em>Michael Davis</em></td>

<td>February</td>
</tr>

<td>January</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells</strong> <br> <em>Andrew Sean Greer</em></td>
<td>This one is about exploring yourself and how you would live your life if you had been born in a different era. The geek in me has some issues with the time travel aspects of the book, but overall, this was a fabulous book. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>
<td>January</td>

<td><strong>Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children</strong> <br> <em>Ransom Riggs</em></td>

<td>December</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Dragonfly in Amber</strong> <br> <em>Diana Gabaldon</em></td>

<td><strong>Once A Runner</strong> <br> <em>John L. Parker, Jr.</em></td>

<td><strong>Blue Willow</strong> <br> <em>Doris Gates</em></td>

<td>September</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Take This Man</strong> <br> <em>Brando Skyhorse</em></td>
<td>This book is a great memoir about the author's search for family, in a very philosophical sense. There is a large cast of characters here, which at times was a little confusing, but worth the read if you can keep everyone straight.</td>
<td>September</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Learning Responsive Web Design</strong> <br> <em>Clarissa Peterson</em></td>

<td><strong>Life of Pi</strong> <br> <em>Yann Martel</em></td>

<tr>
<td><strong>The Book Thief</strong> <br> <em>Markus Zusak</em></td>

<td><strong>The Long Earth</strong> <br> <em>Terry Pratchett &amp; Stephen Baxter</em></td>

<td>August</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Stardust</strong> <br> <em>Neil Gaiman</em></td>

<td><strong>Team Geek</strong> <br> <em>Brian W. Fitzpatrick, Ben Collins-Sussman</em></td>

<td><strong>The Light Between Oceans</strong> <br> <em>M. L. Stedman</em></td>

<td>May</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Javascript: The Good Parts</strong> <br> <em>Douglas Crockford</em></td>
<td>I work with Javascript every day, so I pretty much just skimmed this book. Really good review of lots of JS concepts. Most was review. Parts were new... which was awesome. This would be really useful for beginners.</td>
<td>May</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Astronaut Wives Club</strong> <br> <em>Lily Koppel</em></td>
<td>Life sort of got in the way reading this book, but it really is a good one. Great look at the lives of the wives of the astronauts through the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo missions. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>
<td>April</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>100 Diagrams That Changed The World</strong> <br> <em>Scott Christianson</em></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Smashing Book #3 1/3: Redesign the Web, The Extension</strong> <br> <em>Smashing Magazine</em></td>

<td><strong>11/22/63</strong> <br> <em>Stephen King</em></td>
<td>I vowed a long time ago to not read Stephen King again because his books kind of creep me out. This one is completely different. Yes, it is 800 pages long, but it is completely captivating.

<td>Yes, again. I re-read this book for book club.</td>
<td>December</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>And The Mountains Echoed</strong> <br> <em>Khaled Hosseini</em></td>
<td>This book tells an incredible story about a family. The story itself jumps around enough that I think I need to reread it - mostly because I kept picking up and putting down the book over the course of this month. But definitely worth the read. I cried. In a good way (if that's a thing). Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>
<td>November</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>How to Be an Adult</strong> <br> <em>Nerissa Nields</em></td>
<td>I am a Nields fan, which is how I heard about this book. I am not exactly her target audience (i.e. my 20s were a while ago), but I did gain a lot of insights from this book. Definitely a good read for this not-quite-20-something who doesn't always feel like an adult.</td>
<td>October</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>The Other Typist</strong> <br> <em>Suzanne Rindell</em></td>
<td>This was a very fun book, for varying definitions of the word &quot;fun&quot;. I will not give anything away, but I definitely had different impressions of the book between the first chapter and the last. Very good read. It helps that the 1920s completely fascinate me.</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong> <br> <em>George R. R. Martin</em></td>

<td>September</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Interviewing Users: How to Uncover Compelling Insights</strong> <br> <em>Steve Portigal</em></td>

<td>August</td>

<td><strong>No Frills Magento Layout</strong> <br> <em>Alan Storm</em></td>

<td><strong>JSTL in Action</strong> <br> <em>Shawn Bayern</em></td>

<td>July</td>

<td><strong>The Woman Upstairs</strong> <br> <em>Claire Messud</em></td>
<td>A much lighter read after that last book, but not exactly a &quot;light&quot; read. I totally get Nora.</td>
<td>June</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Team of Rivals</strong> <br> <em>Doris Kearns Goodwin</em></td>
<td>It actually took me two months to read this book. This book is incredibly dense, but it is an amazing and well-written chronicle of Lincoln's political career. I have been a life-long Lincoln fan (really!); this was well worth the read. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>
<td>June</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Calligrapher's Daughter</strong> <br> <em>Eugenia Kim</em></td>
<td>This book was fascinating and frustrating all at the same time - fascinating because Korea is very much in the news now; frustrating because I was hoping for so much more for the main character. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>
<td>April</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>The Impeachment of Abraham Lincoln</strong> <br> <em>Stephen L. Carter</em></td>
<td>This was a really interesting &quot;what-if&quot; book about how Lincoln would have fared if he had survived the assassination attempt. A bit law-ish for me, but completely fascinating. Loved it! <span class='fa fa-heart'></span></td>
<td>March</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Granny Torrelli Makes Soup</strong> <br> <em>Sharon Creech</em></td>

<td><strong>Developing Backbone.js Applications</strong> <br> <em>Addy Osmani</em></td>
