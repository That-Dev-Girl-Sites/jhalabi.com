<h2>Hello World!</h2>
<p>I wrote my first line of code in BASIC on an Apple iiC, sitting in my parent's basement. Soon after that moment, I wrote my first GOTO statement, sending that computer into a fiery fit of sparks and smoke <em>(or something like that)</em>.</p>
<p>My actual childhood was far less destructive and surrounded by computers — that Apple iiC, my beloved TI 99/4A, and eventually an IBM ThinkPad. I also spent my childhood among books, <a href="/reading/">reading anything</a> that struck my interest. <em>(I had and still have eclectic tastes.)</em> My dream was to move into our town library.</p>
<p>Today, I am “middle-end” web developer who likes to write code, commit often, and make up my own titles. I specialize in developing CMS themes and WordPress editor customizations. I <a href="/speaking/">speak at technical conferences</a>, <a href="/blog/">blog about development</a>, and <a href="/book/">write creative works</a> focusing on life as a single mother by choice. In the little spare time that remains, I run, travel with my adventurous kid, enjoy live music, and advocate for the Oxford comma.</p>
