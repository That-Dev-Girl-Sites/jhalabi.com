    <p>I am about to go into &quot;mom mode&quot; for this post, because I recently came across (and <em>almost</em> fell for) the most clever phishing attempt I have seen to date.</p>
<h2>Some background</h2>
<p>I recently had to replace my roof. The details are a much longer, unrelated story. Here are the highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>It rained outside.</li>
<li>Then, it rained <em>inside</em>.</li>
<li>I filed a claim with my insurance company.</li>
<li>A roofer replaced my roof.</li>
<li>The end... mostly.</li>
</ol>
<p>My claim is still open, due to some of the longer, unrelated details. As a result of that, my insurance adjuster called me late last week to give me a status update. During that conversation, he also said that he needed to send out an invoice for some tarping work.</p>
<p>None of this is directly related to the phishing attempt. However, it does serve as context to what happened today.</p>
<h2>The phish</h2>
<p>This morning, I received an email from Ann<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> with the subject line &quot;Find attachment from We Make Roofs LLC&quot;. The email contents said that Ann shared a document with me, via Adobe, and included a link for me to access the file. This was not unusual for them. During the roof replacement process, I received a lot of documents this way -- contracts, receipts, etc.</p>
<p>Given my conversation last week with the adjuster, my first thought was that We Make Roofs LLC was trying to bill me for the aforementioned tarping work. Annoyed <em>(especially since I thought my side of the financials was done)</em>, I clicked the link to figure this out.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Red flag #1:</strong> The link took me to a page that redirected me to another page. The second page immediately asked for a user name and password. I never created an account with We Make Roofs LLC and our previous shared files never required passwords.</p>
<p>I replied to the email, which went to <code>ann@wemakeroofs.com</code><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>, to ask what was going on.</p>
<p><strong>Red flag #2:</strong> A few minutes later, I got a second email from We Make Roofs LLC. This time it was from Patricia, with the subject line &quot;Urgent_ImportantDocs 05-01-2023&quot;. This email didn't go to me directly, but to &quot;Undisclosed Recipients&quot;. This email practically screamed &quot;I'm a phish!&quot;</p>
<p>However, that conversation from the insurance company was still in the back of my mind. I called We Make Roofs LLC, using the contact information I already had for them, to figure out what was going on.</p>
<h2>The real deal</h2>
<p>First of all, Ann and Patricia are real people. Ann is a customer liaison whom I'd spoke with before. Patricia is the head of the billing department.</p>
<p>We Make Roofs LLC is a smaller, local company, and they answered my call right away. The emails were definitely not a legitimate communication attempt. The person I spoke with said that Ann's email had been compromised, but they did not think Patricia's had as well. They had questions when I told them about the emails I had received and promised to relay my experience to their IT department.</p>
<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
<p>Whether the timing of this phish was intentional or not <em>(given my recent communication with insurance)</em>, it almost got me. <em>Almost.</em> I'm sure it worked on someone. I am both impressed and really angry.</p>
<p>In conclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never click on anything.</li>
<li>No really. <em>Never</em> click on <em>anything</em>.</li>
<li>If an email feels suspect at all, especially if it is from a company that you have worked with, just call them.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Stay safe out there.</p>
<section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Names of both people and companies have been changed. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>Yes, I know. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Never click on links in an email, but the context, timing, and my annoyed state made me think this was real. My deepest apologies to every security person I know. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>Again, I changed all the names. <em>This</em> is not a real email, but the email I replied to was a legit email for the real company. <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn4" class="footnote-item"><p>I know, I hate making phone calls too, but sometimes it's good for you. Trust me. <a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
