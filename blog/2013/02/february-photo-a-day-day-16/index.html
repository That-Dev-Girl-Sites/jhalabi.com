    <p>As you probably read a couple of days ago, I have started to take some liberties with this photo-a-day challenge.  Today <em>(or, rather yesterday at this point)</em> is another one of those liberties.  Don't worry. I did take a picture this time.  But there's a (long) story to go with it.</p>
<p>The photo subject for the 16th was &quot;perfect&quot;.  Now, on paper, my day yesterday was pretty darn awesome.  However, I have been dealing with some things lately that have been bringing up more questions than answers, and are making me feel far less than perfect.  So, thinking about perfection is pretty hard.</p>
<p>Long story short about my day yesterday: One of my favorite bands, <a href="http://www.eddiefromohio.com">Eddie From Ohio</a>, is playing their annual 3-night concert series at the Birchmere.  Awesome.  Seriously.  I have been looking forward to this weekend for a while.  As in, since last year.  Local friends come out of the word work.  Not-so-local friends come out too.  It's like a big reunion.  With music.  Really kick-ass music.</p>
<p>So, I took pictures.  Lots of pictures.  The Birchmere is a fantastic place for both listening to music and photographing bands.  (Their stage lights seriously make me happy.  I am a dork.)  However, despite the fact that I took some pretty awesome pictures of a fantastic night, I am still struggling with &quot;perfect&quot; here.</p>
<p>One (other) cool thing about the Birchmere is that there is stuff everywhere.  Photos of artists who played there.  Calendars of shows from years past.  One stood out: January 2009.  EFO played the weekend before President Obama's first inauguration.  I came down for the inauguration <em>(sleeping on some random woman's floor that weekend a la Craigslist; hotels were completely booked!)</em> and was able to catch a couple of the EFO shows while I was here.  That weekend was my first Birchmere experience.  Seeing that calendar was pretty perfect.</p>
