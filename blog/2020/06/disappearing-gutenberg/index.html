    <p>Once upon a time, there was a WordPress post editor that discovered it had turned into a simple HTML editor....</p>
<p>(Apologies to Anne Tyler's <em>Back When We Were Grownups</em>.) But in all seriousness, has this happened to you?</p>
<p>I ask because this just happened to me. Twice. I logged into WordPress to add a new page and discovered that the Gutenberg editor was gone. No, I did not accidentally install the Classic Editor plugin. Gutenberg simply disappeared. The block library icon was there, but not clickable. The editor had been replaced with a text-only HTML editor.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/posts/no-gutenberg.jpg" alt="WordPress editor, which includes the 'Add Title' field, followed by a text-only field with a placeholder saying 'Start writing with text or HTML'">
  <figcaption>What happened to Gutenberg?</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Did I break Gutenberg?</h2>
<p>My first thought was that <em>something</em> must be going on with one of my plugins, so I disabled all custom and contributed plugins. Still no Gutenberg.</p>
<p>Could it be my theme? I activated the core TwentyTwenty theme, instead of my custom theme. Nope. Still no Gutenberg.</p>
<h2>Umm... is core broken?</h2>
<p>At this point, the issue was obviously not with any of my custom code or something I installed. Let's see if core is throwing any errors. I did not see any errors in my browser's developer console, but my PHP error log was throwing errors about not being able to allocate memory.</p>
<p>I checked my <code>php.ini</code> file. I already set my memory limit to 128MB, which is the maximum recommended limit, but just for kicks, I upped it to 512MB.</p>
<p>Still no Gutenberg. And, adding insult to injury, I was <em>still</em> seeing memory allocation errors in my PHP logs. This memory limit issue was already ludicrous, so I concluded that this was unlikely to be the culprit of my Gutenberg issue. This was another issue for another day.</p>
<h2>Help me, Obi-Wan Google. You're my only hope.</h2>
<p>I turned to the Google and found a number of <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/block-editor-no-longer-working-only-shows-html/">support requests</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/12760">issues</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/126110/visual-editor-missing-server-side-problem-how-would-you-debug-it">questions</a>. Many of these suggested troubleshooting techniques that I had already tried, but there were also some new ideas here.</p>
<p>I resaved my permalinks, which was admittedly a non-sensical longshot. Still no Gutenberg.</p>
<p>I cleared my browser cache and cookies. Still no Gutenberg.</p>
<p>I switched browsers. (I had been working in Google Chrome.) Still no Gutenberg.</p>
<h2>The (infuriating) eureka moment.</h2>
<p>I finally came across a <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/block-editor-no-longer-working-only-shows-html/page/3/#post-11093164">support topic that suggested the solution</a>, though it presented itself as a total longshot.</p>
<p>So, what was this solution? <strong>Make sure your WordPress user profile has a nickname.</strong></p>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/posts/profile-with-nickname.jpg" alt="WordPress admin user screen, with the username, first name, last name, and nickname fields. The username and nickname fields are filled out.">
  <figcaption>Make sure your WordPress user has a nickname. It is apparently important.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The user nickname is a required field, but, somehow when I created my account, the nickname did not get set. Apparently, being logged in as a user with no nickname causes issues, like <strong>Gutenberg not f$#@$-ing loading</strong>.</p>
<p>So, remember folks, make sure your WordPress user account has a nickname. Otherwise, WordPress will get angry. You don't want to make WordPress angry.</p>
