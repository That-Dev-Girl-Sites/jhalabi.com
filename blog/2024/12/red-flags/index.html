    <p>Let's talk about red flags for a moment.</p>
<p>I have seen many over the course of my career. One in particular that comes to mind is an interview I had several years ago. The interview was with a larger organization who was hiring for several open developer positions. As I walked into the office, I saw a flurry of people going here and there. One escorted me to an office, where I waited until a very hurried individual came in. She introduced herself as the hiring manager and announced that she did not really have time to interview me. After rushing through a few questions, she left. I showed myself out.</p>
<p>I got the job.</p>
<p>I rejected the job.</p>
<p>I said no because that level of chaos and disorganization screamed at me to run far away. Everything about that interview felt unstable, and I knew that was not an environment I wanted to be a part of.</p>
<p>I feel the same way about WordPress today. I have been watching the drama between WordPress and WPEngine unfold over the last several months with a combination of concern and bewilderment.</p>
<p>I won't recap all of the pieces of this drama, but one of the weirder pieces was the &quot;alliance&quot; login checkbox, where users had to pledge that they were not affiliated with WPEngine in order to log into <a href="http://WordPress.org">WordPress.org</a>.</p>
<p>Today I (and the rest of the WordPress community) discovered that WordPress took down that checkbox (as ordered by a judge), and replaced it with a new checkbox. Now, users need to assert that &quot;pineapple is delicious on pizza.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/wordpress-pineapple.jpg" alt="Wordpress.org login screen, with the user name and password fields filled in, but redacted. Below the form is a checkbox with the label Pineapple is delicious on pizza. It is unchecked, and has an error message saying please check this box if you want to proceed." width="75%"></p>
<p>If this does not scream instability, I don't know what does.</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that I cannot stand pineapple on pizza (please don't @ me), this is the biggest and most public red flag I have ever seen. And I am more concerned and bewildered than I was before.</p>
