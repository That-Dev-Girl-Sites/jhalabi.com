  <article class="post-article" aria-labelledby="post-title">
    <p>Almost a year ago, I published an article about what could be described as the <a href="/blog/2023/04git-reversions-by-tag">worst way to revert tags in git</a>. I regret that article. The process I outlined there was an experiment gone awry. I conclude the post by telling my readers to &quot;use the knowledge here at your own risk.&quot; I hope you all listened.</p>
<p>I am bringing this up because I was recently put into a situation (<em>again</em>) where I needed to revert a git repository back to a specific tag. This is not a task I do often, so off to the internet I went, entering the keywords &quot;git revert by tag&quot; into the search bar. This unearthed my previous post.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<h2>This is promising?</h2>
<p>I completely forgot about this post and, at first, was very excited. That is, until I actually <em>read</em> the entire post. I was disappointed, but determined to find a better way. The other top search results were not the step-by-step tutorial that I was hoping for, but, eventually, I found a method that I am much happier with.</p>
<h2>The current state of my repo</h2>
<p>My goal was to revert my repo to a previous tag, but, unlike last year's &quot;solution&quot;, not destroy any commits along the way. The <code>git log</code> looked something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">11111 (HEAD -&gt; main, tag: LatestTag) Latest commit
22222 Another fun feature
33333 Fun feature
44444 (tag: PreviousTag) More changes
55555 Random changes
66666 (tag: MuchOlderTag) Changes
</code></pre>
<p>The log starts with the most recent commit and goes backwards in time. My most recent commit was tagged (<code>LatestTag</code>), but I needed to revert this repo back to an older tag -- <code>PreviousTag</code>. This change would revert 3 commits: <code>11111</code>, <code>22222</code>, and <code>33333</code>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<h2>Step 1: Revert the repo locally</h2>
<p>This first step is to revert the repo locally to its state at the <code>PreviousTag</code> tag by rolling each commit back <em>separately</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">git revert HEAD..PreviousTag
</code></pre>
<p>A confirmation of each commit's reversion appears as part of this <code>revert</code> command. Git treats each reversion as its own commit, so you will need to review and save each commit as they pop up on your screen.</p>
<p>There is a chance that some merge conflicts will arise. I did not encounter that, but if you do, use whatever method you usually use to resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>Once git has finished rolling back each commit, a <code>git status</code> looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">[main 33333a] Revert &quot;Fun feature&quot;
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
[main 22222a] Revert &quot;Another fun feature&quot;
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
[main 11111a] Revert &quot;Latest commit&quot;
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
</code></pre>
<p>Three changes were reverted, resulting in three, separate commits.</p>
<h2>Step 2: Verify and push</h2>
<p>Reverting one commit can be daunting. Reverting <em>multiple</em> commits is a big deal. I cannot stress this enough: Test your code before doing anything else!</p>
<p>Once you have verified that that your code works as expected, push the changes to remote.</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">git push origin main
</code></pre>
<h2>Step 3: Goal achieved!</h2>
<p>Not only has the repo been reverted to its previous commit, but the commit history has been preserved <em>and</em> each reversion is saved as a separate commit <em>(just in case you need to do more &quot;fun&quot; things with git)</em>.</p>
<p>Now, do yourself a favor and forget about last year's post.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>My post was the third link on the search results page. <em>Third.</em> That is either embarassing or pretty amazing SEO. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>The commit hashes were (obviously) changed to something easier to read, so no one gets lost in a sea of characters. At the very least, this is easier on my eyes. You're welcome. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>One may ask why I don't just delete that old post. I don't really believe in deleting my old content (unless it is truly harmful). That old post is not a great idea, but I also admit that in the post, so I hope readers will take that to heart. <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
