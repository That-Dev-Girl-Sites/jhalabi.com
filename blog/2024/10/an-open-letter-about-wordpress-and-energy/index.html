    <p>Dear Matt,</p>
<p>I am tired. This is not the kind of tired that a good night's sleep will solve. This kind of tired stems from having too much on my plate -- both good and terrible. I started a new role at work that I am beyond excited about. <em>(Good.)</em> I am a single parent to an amazing 6 year-old. <em>(Really good.)</em> As for the terrible, they are personal things that I will only share privately.</p>
<p>This combination of good and terrible things take up my space, time, and energy. Actually, let me correct that. They take up <strong>all</strong> my space, time, and energy.</p>
<p>You are relevant to my professional space. My current professional life is linked to WordPress. I love WordPress. I love Gutenberg.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> I write <a href="/coding/">plugins</a> that live in Plugin Directory. Most of my <a href="/speaking/">presentations</a> center around WordPress, be it developing blocks, writing accessible markup, or discussing the latest updates to Gutenberg. I have friends within the WordPress community -- friends I otherwise would never have met. I even <em>(somewhat accidentally)</em> started the push within my current organization to migrate our 400+ sites from a different CMS into WordPress.</p>
<p>I have no regrets about my ties to WordPress. It is a solid system that I love creating with and developing for. You could even make the argument that I <em>need</em> WordPress.</p>
<p>What I <em>do not need</em> is for the leader of WordPress to go off the rails in some <em>(seemingly personal)</em> battle that has only succeeded in creating uncertainty and distrust in the larger WordPress community.</p>
<p>I appreciate the need to protect the WordPress name. I really do! I have had my own share of copyright issues. I have needed to send cease-and-desist letters to people selling my <em>(otherwise free)</em> written works. That is never fun.</p>
<p>However, there is a difference between defending your intellectual property and setting half the internet on fire.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Prior to last month, I was never concerned about the future of WordPress. I never had a reason to be. Now, I do. This goes back to my space, time, and energy problem.</p>
<p>I should not have to make space in my life to worry about the damage being done to WordPress and our community. I should not have to spend time losing trust in a system that I have worked in for years. I should not have to spend energy watching a grown adult have more meltdowns than my literal child.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> I <em>do not</em> have the space, time, or energy for <em>any</em> of this.</p>
<p>I am tired. And angry. And extremely disappointed. This is not the behavior of a leader.</p>
<p>I expected better from you, and it is definitely time for a time out. Go sit in a corner and think about what you've done.</p>
<p>Sincerely, <br>
An exhausted code mom</p>
<section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Is liking Gutenberg still controversial? Whatever. I meant what I said. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>I will not rehash the entire battle <em>(to date)</em>. Some great resources on the subject already exist. I really like <a href="https://wpvswpe.report/">one resource in particular</a>, but I am sure there are others. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>My kid is great and, at 6, has far fewer meltdowns than she did at 3. However, she <em>is</em> a kid and the occasional meltdown is expected. I expect more emotional maturity from adults. <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
