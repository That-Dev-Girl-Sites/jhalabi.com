    <p>It has been a year. Some of us have had a really rough year, while others had a pretty good year, but feel awkward admitting that 2016 wasn't all that bad.</p>
<p>At the end of 2015, I had asked for a stranger new year. Not quite what I mean, but I think I got it. It was definitely a year filled with some pretty awful things, but a friend inspired me to focus on the positive, so here goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>After getting laid off from a particularly toxic job at the end of 2015, I spent this year reinventing myself professionally. I started my own one-woman consulting business. I started teaching (and really liked it). One of my clients turned into a full-time job that I am really loving.</li>
<li>After burning out from running at the end of 2015 and having several terrible arguments with my joints, my knees and I have finally made peace and agreed upon a new running schedule that is making us all happy.</li>
<li>It was an exciting travel year, not so much in quantity, but definitely quality.  This year, I found myself in Alaska the week before my birthday with a fantastic group of friends.  I took a mini-trip in the fall to Minnesota and rounded out the year with a road trip through New England to ring in 2017.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the part where I make resolutions for next year, right?</p>
<p>To be honest, I hate resolutions.  I resolve to run more or save more or read more or ride a unicorn across the country. And then do none of these things. And then feel bad when I look back and the end of the year and realize that I did none of these things.</p>
<p>So, no resolutions here! My plan is to be realistic and do things that are useful or joyful.  Shoot! Is that a resolution in disguise?</p>
<p>Happy new year everyone!</p>
