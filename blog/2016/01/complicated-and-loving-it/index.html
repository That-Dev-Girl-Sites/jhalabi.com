    <p>2015 was a strange, strange year.</p>
<p>I started the year with a brand new job that had a ton of potential.  I later discovered working for that particular company was a huge mistake and, after being miserable for several months, had the opportunity to walk away in October.  After about 5 minutes of soul-searching <em>(long winded introspection is not really my thing)</em>, I decided that jumping to another company would be another mistake.</p>
<h2>So I decided to go rogue.</h2>
<p>I mean, why work as a consultant through an agency when I can simply work as a consultant as myself?  Right?</p>
<p>Yes, that is completely crazy.  Agencies exist for a reason and I have <em>zero</em> experience in the business world.  I have never had to market myself to anyone.  Not to mention deal with invoicing and contracts and taxes, etc.</p>
<p>It took me about 2 minutes of soul-searching before I hit send on my first batch of &quot;cold-call&quot; marketing messages.</p>
<h2>Fast forward 2 months.</h2>
<p>I am very close to launching my first client site as a &quot;rogue&quot; developer.  I have 2 more sites in progress.  I am teaching my very own class at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/">General Assembly</a>.  And, I just signed 2 long-term contracts with a couple of really big organizations.  <em>(Not dropping names yet, but you've definitely heard of them.  And one rhymes with &quot;Shmacys&quot;.)</em></p>
<p>Not bad for someone with no practical business experience.</p>
<p>Yes, my work life is more complicated.  My schedule is more complicated.  Taxes are more complicated.  <em>(Thank goodness for CPAs.)</em>  But having control over my own time and flexibility?  Priceless.</p>
