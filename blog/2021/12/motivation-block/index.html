    <p>I have been meaning to write more, mostly to have some sort of creative outlet that does not involve code. Don't get me wrong. I love coding and still have about 20 different side projects and ideas that I want to work on. However, writing code for fun after writing code all day for work has not sounded... well... fun these days.</p>
<p>After writing the manuscript for <em>Sweet Little You</em>, I realized that I like writing. That is weird to say after years of saying that I hate writing. Maybe I was writing the wrong things. <em>(I'm looking at you, technical documentation.)</em></p>
<p>So, of course, after deciding that I really do enjoy writing, I stopped having the motivation for it. To be honest, between work and parenting, I stopped having the motivation for a lot of &quot;extras&quot;. After work is over and mini-me is in bed, I am just <em>tired</em>.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> So, I have not written in months. I have a giant list of ideas, but no motivation to work through them. The writing bug decided to hibernate. It's not quite writer's block because it feels different. I've been calling it &quot;motivation block&quot;.</p>
<p>Then, today happened. After a Covid exposure that quarantined us during Christmas and grounded us from seeing family and celebrating. After the quarantine ended and I looked forward to having a completely quiet house in the in-between days when I am off of work, but the kiddo has (pre)school. After really needing that break of a kid- and work-free day, today happened. A positive Covid test result. Positive despite quarantining for 10 days. Positive despite having no symptoms. We are now in isolation for the few remaining days of my work-free holiday.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>I'm not going to lie. That wrecked me.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> And <em>that</em> made me feel guilty because of the implication that I don't want to spend time with my own child. I love my child. But, every so often, mommy needs a break.</p>
<p>I spent pretty much the entire day going between being perfectly fine and perfectly sad. It made me wonder what my kid was thinking when I looked sad. Today was new territory for us. She didn't say anything and she is the queen of deflecting. Is she sad too?</p>
<p>So, after we finished playing and watching way too much <em>Paw Patrol</em> and eating dinner and saying night night, I sat down and wrote. I wrote an entire story. I wrote about a girl and about being so sad that you just don't want to move.</p>
<p>I don't know if what I wrote will ever see the light of day, but I wrote. I wrote about how I feel and now I feel a whole lot better. That is one strong motivation block cure.</p>
