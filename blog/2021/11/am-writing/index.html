  <article class="post-article" aria-labelledby="post-title">
    <p>It has been a busy year! Between running after my newly-minted preschooler, excitedly settling into life as a fully remote worker, and remodeling our kitchen, you would think I would have time for little else.</p>
<p>I thought the same. Then my brain starting talking. <em>Do you remember all of those books that you and mini-you have been reading about how she was made?</em>, it asked.</p>
<p><em>Do you remember how those books felt just a little too advanced when she was a baby?</em>, it continued.</p>
<p><em>Do you remember loving, but not feeling seen in all of your &quot;welcome to the family&quot; books that talk about Daddy and &quot;we welcome&quot; and &quot;we love&quot; and &quot;we&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;we&quot;?</em>, it pushed.</p>
<h2>Yup, you definitely have a point.</h2>
<p>We read <em>a lot</em> in this house. I have shelves and shelves of books. Mini-me now also has shelves and shelves of books. Many of her books were gifted; others were my own impulse buys.</p>
<p>One of my goals as a single mother by choice is for my child to never experience a big reveal moment, where she learns about who her biological father is. In fact, she was only a few days old when I first told her about her bio-dad. Not that she remembers that, of course.</p>
<p>In a more recent effort to explain the topic to her, I bought and read to her a bunch of single mother by choice books that are specifically tailored for kids.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> However, they <em>did</em> feel like a bit too much for mini-me when she was younger. Nothing she could have grasped when she was a baby or even a toddler, for sure. She's just starting to get it now as a preschooler.</p>
<p>Then I thought about all of the &quot;welcome baby&quot; books that we were gifted, mostly during my baby shower.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> We love those too, but they are all written from that perspective of a 2-parent (usually heterosexual) household. While beautiful, they are mildly awkward for us.</p>
<h2><em>Do something!,</em> whispers my brain.</h2>
<p>OMG brain, listen here. I am <em>so</em> busy with everything else. Remember work? And those side-dev projects that I keep meaning to work on? <em>[Cue hysterical laughter from <strong>every</strong> developer reading this.]</em> And the fact that I'm solo-parenting that aforementioned mini-me? When am I supposed to find time to write a book?!?!</p>
<h2>So, naturally, I wrote a book.</h2>
<p>Yup. Seriously, this nerdy programmer who went to a school that barely has an English department wrote a book. It came to me weirdly quickly in a fit that was about half inspiration and half frustration.</p>
<p><em>Sweet Little You</em> is a picture book, primarily geared to ages 0-2, that welcomes a new baby to their single-parent family. My goal is for any single-parent family to see themselves in this book, mostly because really want there to be a &quot;welcome baby&quot; book option for families like ours.</p>
<p>I've already had it edited and had a few people informally read it and give comments. And I've taken a couple of online classes on how self-publish because (a) that feels like the best route for me because I want to retain full creative control and (b) I have no idea what I'm doing and really needed classes on this.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm in the process of looking for an illustrator, which is more anxiety-inducing than I imagined it would be. More on that in a future post, mostly because I have quite a bit to say about this process. For now, consider this to be my &quot;coming out as a writer&quot; post.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
