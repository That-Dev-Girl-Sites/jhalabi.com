    <p>I am a published author.</p>
<p>Wow. Publishing a children's book was a shock, probably to everyone, but especially to me. I never thought that &quot;author&quot; would ever be a word that I could use to describe myself. Yet, here we are.</p>
<p>I suppose this should not be <em>too</em> surprising. I spent my high school years writing (pretty terrible) poetry, some of which was published in our school's creative writing magazine. I started blogging when  I first got access to the internet. I'm not even sure we called it blogging at the time. I updated my hand-coded and likely horribly inaccessible website with &quot;updates&quot;.</p>
<p>This was back in 1996, which was a bit late for many folks my age. The internet was not a household thought when I was growing up and my parents were rarely early adopters of technology. I first got online when I was in college, where freshman orientation included a crash course on the internet, email, and how to use the command line. <em>(The vast majority of our university systems were some flavor of UNIX workstation.)</em> I taught myself the basics of HTML <em>(and later CSS, after it came to be)</em>, and soon my website was born.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<h2>My writing history</h2>
<p>Like I said, I have been writing for a while. Most of the things I have written remain unread <em>(probably)</em>. Some have gained a bit of popularity, like the <a href="/blog/pregnancy/">chronical of my pregnancy</a> and my <a href="/blog/2022/03/carousels-no-one-likes-you">rant on why you should never, ever, ever put a carousel on your website</a>.</p>
<p>I speak at conferences too. I 100% count this as a form of writing, since it involves much of the same process. Think of a topic. Outline the shape of topic's story. Write in the details. Speaking simply adds another step: Say the words out loud.</p>
<p>Over time, I have discovered that most of my writing that has been more popular<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> was born out of some amount of frustration or otherwise had an emotional drive. My pregnancy story was quite the complicated ride.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> Website carousels are the bane of my professional existence. Most of my conference talks are almost always born out of whatever new hottness I am working on in any given year.</p>
<h2>And now?</h2>
<p><a href="/book/"><em>Sweet Little You</em></a> is no different. This book was born out of both love and frustration. I love my daughter and we love reading together. We have a ton of books. There are books in every room of our house.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Among our collection are &quot;welcome baby&quot; books. They are cute and I love them. In fact, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26457275-welcome-little-one"><em>Welcome Little One</em></a> is the first book I ever read to my daughter and is still one of our favorites. However, just about all of these &quot;welcome&quot; books use plural pronouns. We. Us. Our. The messages are beautiful, but slightly awkward for a single-parent family.</p>
<p>Our collection also includes children's books about single-moms-by-choice (SMC) and donor conception. I brought and read these to introduce my daughter to the concept of how she came to be and why. Books like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52567923-mommy-and-me---how-i-came-to-be"><em>Mommy and Me: How I Came To Be</em></a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38671815-for-mommy-so-loved-you"><em>For Mommy So Loved You</em></a> are also in regular reading rotation in our house. These books are fantastic now that my daughter 4, but, me being me, I wanted to introduce her to these concepts as early as possible. In fact, I told her about her &quot;bio-dad&quot; <em>(the donor I used to conceive)</em> when she was just a few days old.</p>
<p>Right, I know. Way too young for her to understand any of this. However, my philosophy has always been that I don't want her to remember when I first told her about her bio-dad. I don't want there to be a big reveal moment in her life. My goal is to make our &quot;mommy and me&quot; family as natural to her as possible.</p>
<p>To that end, I was craving a &quot;welcome baby&quot; book that is inclusive of single-parent families <em>(e.g. no plural pronouns!)</em> and at the level of a newborn, who is not going to fully grasp the concept of a SMC.</p>
<p>So, <a href="/book/"><em>Sweet Little You</em></a> was born. It is a book where a mother welcomes her donor-conceived baby into the world. She promises to love them. She acknowledges their origin story without getting into the details.</p>
<p><a href="/book/"><em>Sweet Little You</em></a> is the book I wanted to exist when my daughter was born and I am so excited to share it with anyone else who may be craving the same.</p>
<p>So, shameless plug here. Please spread the word. And, if you have read the book and are so inclined, please leave an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Little-You-Joni-Halabi/dp/057839216X">Amazon review</a>. Even if you are not a fan of Amazon<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>, it helps with rankings and such.</p>
<section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>That is, more than 1 person has read it. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>Thanks, in no small part, to hormones, but going it solo definitely helped to feed the fire. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>Except the bathrooms. I don't want to yuck anyone's yum, but bathroom books are not for us. <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn4" class="footnote-item"><p>Fun fact that I just learned, you do not need to buy a book on Amazon to review it. You can support your local bookstore or borrow a book from a library and still leave a review on Amazon. For better or worse, Amazon is great for exposure, especially for those of us who self-publish, and ratings help with Amazon rankings and recommendations. <a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
