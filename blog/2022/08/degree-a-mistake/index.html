    <p>With the latest news about exponentially-rising tuition costs and student debt forgiveness, I keep asking myself whether college was truly necessary. Truth be told, I have been asking that quite a bit over the years.</p>
<p>I went to college in the late 1990s, starting off as a dual major in computer science and physics. I wanted to work for NASA. I knew I would never cut it as an astronaut, though I had been dreaming about it since I was 8 years old. So, college-freshman me decided working as a scientist was the next best thing.</p>
<p>About a year into the program, I made a life-changing discovery. I cannot stand calculus. As in, I would have rather watched a video upload via a 28k modem<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> than solved a differential equation. This was a bit of a problem, being a physics major.</p>
<p>I was not a huge fan of the computer science program either. At that point, I had discovered the internet and immediately fell in love. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript outside of my classes. Creating a website was far more rewarding than writing C++ and STL code that took forever to compile and often crashed my computer. These computer science course programs seemed to neither work nor bring me joy.
I switched my major, keeping computer science, but adding on electronic media as a second major. I thought the combination of the two could come close to a &quot;web design and development&quot; degree. I know this degree exists now, but there was no such thing back in the 90s, so this was close enough.</p>
<h2>Fast forward to today.</h2>
<p>Now, more than 20 years later, there <em>are</em> web development university programs. There are also bootcamps, certificate courses, and self-driven tutorials. All of these options are as good, if not better, than a university program.</p>
<p>Yes, I said it.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> A web development bootcamp, for example, is as good or better than going to college. These programs have several advantages over a traditional university degree:</p>
<ol>
<li>These programs are designed so that it is possible to learn development skills in a very short amount of time, often months rather than years.</li>
<li>Because of their rapidity, they are frequently updated to keep pace with a developer's world of constantly changing languages, libraries, and standards.</li>
<li>Bootcamps, especially, have a singular goal of giving students exactly the skills they need to get an entry-level job. Many also include career support services.</li>
<li>These programs are generally <em>way</em> cheaper than a typical 4-year degree.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, universities have their own distinct advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>The slower pace of a 4-year degree means that students can dive deeper into subjects.</li>
<li>Being a part of university life opens students up to new people and experiences<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</li>
<li>In the end, a student has a college degree, which, maddeningly, is still a requirement for many employers.</li>
</ol>
<h2>But, is it worth it?</h2>
<p>I have noticed that more and more job postings are less focused on a degree requirement and more focused on demonstrable skills. Can you prove you know language X or library Y? That is a much more reachable bar for people to grab. Instead of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend a bunch of money<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> and/or take out a bunch of loans to go to university.</li>
<li>Learn a bunch of skills, many of which from your freshman year will be out of date by your senior year.</li>
<li>Earn a degree.</li>
<li>Get a job by showing off everything you learned in university.</li>
<li>Spend many years or even decades paying off the aforementioned loans<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>, while still...</li>
<li>Continually learn new skills outside of college to keep up with your ever-changing industry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, a person can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend far less money to go to a bootcamp or no money to learn via self-taught tutorials.</li>
<li>Learn a bunch of skills at your own pace. You can spend as much or as little time on a skill but, this is usually far less than 4 years.</li>
<li>Develop a portfolio that shows off your skills.</li>
<li>Get a job by showing off your portfolio and bragging that you can take the initiative to learn new skills, because you already did that to get this far.</li>
<li>Continually learn more new skills to keep up with your ever-changing industry.</li>
</ol>
<p>I find it very promising that many more employers now realize the latter path is just as valid a career path as a college degree.</p>
<h2>So, did <em>I</em> make a mistake getting a degree?</h2>
<p>The short answer is, no. I don't think so at least. A degree is 100% not a requirement to get a web development job now, but the career landscape was much, much different 25 years ago. A college degree was my only choice at the time. There were no bootcamps. There was not much in the way of self-driven tutorials. Being &quot;self-taught&quot; at that time involved going to a website and hitting &quot;view source&quot; in the browser. Tutorials are much fancier <em>(and useful!)</em> now.</p>
<p>Is getting a degree right for you, future web developer? Well, I don't know you, so I can't answer that. You need to decide that for yourself. However, I will say that getting a degree is, by far, not your only option. You can get a good web development job, with or without a degree. As long as you learn the skills and can prove you can code, you'll do just fine.</p>
