    <p>Once upon a time, there was a (not exactly) young girl who decided to have a full-time tech job, solo-parent a pre-schooler, and publish a book. &quot;I am so organized!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I can totally manage my time to get this done.&quot;</p>
<h2>Act I, scene 1: Hahahaha</h2>
<p><em>[Cue the universe, laughing, saying &quot;Oh really? Hold my beer.&quot;]</em></p>
<p>Enter school closures. And snow (in the mid-Atlantic, where they think they can handle snow, but they really can't). And red alert worthy emergencies at work... <em>all month</em>. And weekend weather so icky, that you need to organize indoor, Covid-friendly activities for the aforementioned pre-schooler.</p>
<p><em>[Spotlight on a really exhausted human.]</em></p>
<h2>Next scene: Remembering the excitement</h2>
<p>This really exhausted human is also at the beginning stages of having her book illustrated. I found a really amazing illustrator and, upon seeing the first drafts of the start of the book, I. Am. <strong>Excited</strong>!</p>
<p>There is still a ton of work to do, but seeing the main characters -- mommy and baby -- in real, illustrated life has made this book feel real. It was a real book before, but practically speaking, it was really just a cute poem.</p>
<p>I am dying to share more about the illustrations, but I am practicing my patience. I promise a cover reveal will happen when the time is right. Just not quite yet.</p>
<h2>Act II: I have so much to do! Ahhhh!</h2>
<p>This excitement has made me realize that I have <em>so</em> much work to do. Mostly marketing. Constant marketing.</p>
<p>I have no idea how to market anything.</p>
<p>For the last 20 years, I have been working with code. Not working alone, but certainly not getting other people to buy the things I code. That's what the marketing department was for.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Now... <em>I'm</em> the marketing department.</p>
<p>Well... that's terrifying. What do I do? Shout into the void?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> I mean, I'm tweeting more and have 400+ followers now! Yes, I know that's not a giant amount (and a good amount of my followers are fellow techies) but it's certainly more than before. I'm pretty excited to have this many. And it's a good start, right?</p>
<p>In reality, I do have a (very large) to do list of marketing ideas that I need to get started on. As soon as I have more time.</p>
<p><em>[Cue the really exhausted human look back at Act 1 of this <s>play</s> blog post.]</em></p>
