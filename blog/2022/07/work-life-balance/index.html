    <p>Joni is a full time developer. Joni is a single mom with a 4 year old. Joni is a newly <em>(almost)</em> published author. <em>(T-3 days until launch!)</em> Joni is a self-published author, which means Joni is also a PR agent. How does she do it all? We don't know. She’s not sure either. Seriously, it’s amazing everyone is still in one piece and the house didn’t burn down.</p>
<h2>Getting a little serious now.</h2>
<p>Really, when did I get so busy? Back in my younger years, I would go to work, come home, and call it a day. These days? Not so much. I still go to work, but I no longer commute. <em>(Thanks pandemic?)</em><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Theoretically, I should have more free time now, but I have a 4 year old, so in reality, I have less free time. In fact, I am in free-time debt.</p>
<h2>When in Rome...</h2>
<p>Obviously, the natural solution to having no free time is to write and publish a book. Because, when you have <em>(time)</em> debt, why not get some more?<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p><a href="/book/"><em>Sweet Little You</em></a> is 100% a passion project. In fact, before writing the book, I was actually considering going to grad school to study machine learning.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> However, the idea for this book came to me with such a force, I couldn't stop myself from writing it. After that, I had this baby of a book that I just <em>needed</em> to edit and proofread and get reviewed. I found myself looking up illustrators and typing &quot;how to self-publish a children's book&quot; into my browser.</p>
<h2>Long story short.</h2>
<p>Nearly one year later, here we are. <a href="/book/"><em>Sweet Little You</em></a> will be officially born<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> on August 1, just 3 short days from when I am writing this.</p>
<p>So now, when I am not working my regular job and when I'm not being a mom, <em>(though, let's get real, when I am I ever not being a mom??)</em>, I am the exclusive PR representative for... me. It's not a terrible arrangement so far. PR-rep-me has already lined up book reviews, interviews, and even a little bit of buzz on Instagram. If release day goes well, I may even double her salary.</p>
<p>In the meantime, actual-me doesn't have time to sleep much, which is how I find myself writing rambling articles about my lack of work/life balance at 12:58am. It's OK. Sleep is for the weak.</p>
<p>I'm kidding. Sleep is good for you. Go get your 8 hours of sleep and, while you're at it, eat well, exercise, and watch plenty of sci fi. Your balanced-you will thank you.</p>
<section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Not to be glib, because the pandemic, especially the early parts, were <em>awful</em>. I could get into that more, but I won't. At least not here. Maybe in another blog post. But the pandemic is directly related to my now-permanent work-from-home status, and that is a change that I never, ever want to revert. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>This is terrible advice, financial or otherwise. Do not, under any circumstances, listen to me. <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3" class="footnote-item"><p>True story. <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn4" class="footnote-item"><p>Books are &quot;born&quot; on their official release date. Seems fitting here, since this is a book for babies. <a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
