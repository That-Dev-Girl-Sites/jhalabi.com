  <article class="post-article" aria-labelledby="post-title">
    <p>I have finally started working on my baby registry. I have been feeling quite a bit of angst about this whole registry-making process for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have never registered for anything in my life.</li>
<li>I have never had a baby, so I need <em>all the things</em>.</li>
<li>For every one &quot;thing&quot; that I need, there are (approximately) 86 varieties of that &quot;thing&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Where to register?</h2>
<p>I started by sifting through all of the places I could register with, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Target <em>(They do have baby stuff, but don't exactly scream &quot;baby&quot;.)</em></li>
<li>Amazon <em>(Too many choices. Then again, I could register for anything. Does a new tablet count as a baby need?)</em></li>
<li>Babies R Us <em>(Actually a baby store, but aren't they going out of business?)</em></li>
<li>buybuy Baby <em>(Definitely a baby store.)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to go with buybuy Baby. Not only are they actually a baby store, but they have a crib that I really like and I am pretty sure they will be around through my delivery. <em>(Again, sorry Babies R Us!)</em></p>
<h2>Creating the registry</h2>
<p>I started my registry online, which immediately sent me to a screen asking me to make an appointment with a registry consultant in the store. I had two reactions to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sweet! I get help with this!</li>
<li>Oh crap! I'm making a registry for real?!?</li>
</ol>
<p>I made the appointment, but was pretty nervous about it. As in, the kind of nervousness you feel when you are walking into a test and haven't even started to study for it. Heck, I don't even own the book! Am I supposed to already know about all of the kinds of strollers that exist? Or about bottle nipple sizes? Wait a sec. Bottle nipples come in <em>sizes?</em> I'm so screwed....</p>
<p>Fortunately, a friend agreed to come with me for support. She doesn't have kids either, but having another human to bounce ideas off of was amazing.</p>
<p>Double-fortunately, the consultant was amazing and took me on a tour of all the baby things. She made recommendations and explained what items are better than others (and in some cases, what a few items are in the first place). This was not a test, but at the end of 90 minutes, I had a good 50-ish item start on my registry.</p>
<h2>Later that day...</h2>
<p>I logged onto my registry that evening to tweak a few of the items I put on my registry, adjust some quantities, and generally sanity check the list. Several hours and about 100 more items later, I have a list that is probably still only 75% complete.</p>
<p>Geez, this kid needs a lot of stuff.</p>
<h2>Current registry status</h2>
<p>I am still reviewing my registry and have asked for help from my family, which consists of actual mothers. I also have a list of things that still need to be added to the registry list, but these items require a bit more research. I am hoping to finish the registry before the kiddo is born.</p>
