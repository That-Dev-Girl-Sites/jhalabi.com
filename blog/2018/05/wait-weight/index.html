    <p>One of my biggest worries about getting pregnant was the inherent weight gain that comes with it. Yes, I know that sounds really superficial. Yes, I know that I am growing a <em>second human</em> inside of my body and, of course, she adds to my overall weight.</p>
<h2>When I was young(er)</h2>
<p>I have had a lot of issues with my body image throughout my entire life. When I was younger, I couldn't run to the corner without feeling like I was about to die. As a teenager, I would read teen magazines that would say things like &quot;if you can pinch an inch, you need to lose 10 pounds&quot;... and then I would discover that I could pinch <em>way</em> more than an inch. I would look at my thighs and see them literally double in width when I sat down.</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking. I should love my body no matter what size or shape it is. And you're right. But, let's also face facts here. I was far from the pinnacle of health in my youth.</p>
<p>It is why I stopped eating beef when I was 18. It is why I decided to finally check out the gym when I was 22. It is why started running when I was 24. <em>(Well, there was also this boy... never mind.)</em> It is why I tried out yoga and practiced for years. It is why I started boxing. It (and the fact that I am super competitive) is why I ran a marathon at 37. <em>(Random aside: The genetics that gave me my family's knees are why I will never run another marathon.)</em></p>
<p>Eventually, I became <em>much</em> healthier and my body reflected that. I lost a bunch of weight. I gained a bunch of muscle. Yet I was still not 100% happy with how I looked. I am perpetually curvy. And it didn't help that every so often, before I got pregnant, someone would ask me if I was pregnant.</p>
<h2>Important message to the universe</h2>
<p><strong>Do not</strong> ask a woman if she is pregnant <strong>unless you see an actual baby coming out of her.</strong></p>
<h2>Flash forward</h2>
<p>I am now in my third trimester. I've gained weight <em>(obviously)</em> and I am now officially back <em>up</em> to my high school weight. I knew this would happen <em>(again, obviously)</em> and I look <em>nothing</em> like I did in high school and college. However, it is still a weird and emotional milestone. <em>(Thanks, hormones?)</em></p>
<p>At least this time around, I have a good reason to be here.</p>
