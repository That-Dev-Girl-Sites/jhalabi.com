    <p>I will be 13 weeks pregnant tomorrow. This is huge because it means, not only am I super officially out of my first trimester, but I am also at a point where I have been getting a lot of test results back.</p>
<h2>The 12 week checkup</h2>
<p>I had my 12 week checkup with my OB late last week. No sonogram but the doctor did pull out a tiny little machine from his pocket to check the baby's heartbeat. The kiddo's heart sounds fantastic!</p>
<h2>All the genetic testing</h2>
<p>Because I am &quot;old&quot;, I had a couple of genetic screenings done. The first was a blood test that tests for a long list of genetic conditions, including Trisomy 21 (Downs Syndrome) and Trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome). It is also a very accurate test for the baby's sex. In this test, they take a million <em>(well, four)</em> vials of blood and tell you that results won't come in for fourteen business days. That's great news to hear just before a holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I got the results <em>much</em> earlier than anticipated. <strong>Everything is normal!</strong></p>
<p>Also... <strong>it's a girl!!!</strong></p>
<p><em>(No, I am not doing a gender reveal party. Obviously. I'm just announcing this to everyone via email, blog post, group text, random shouting, and carrier pigeon.)</em></p>
<p>The second genetic test happened today and included a very extensive ultrasound, where I got to see my baby from literally every angle. I even got to see her bladder. Twice.</p>
<p>It was the coolest thing ever. (I am not just talking about her bladder.) She looks like a fully formed human! I got to see her head, nose, hands, feet, knees... just about everything. So. Amazing.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/ultrasound-week-13.jpg" alt="Ultrasound image of the kiddo at week 13" :width="75%"></p>
<p>More good news: <strong>Everything is still normal!</strong></p>
<h2>Chatting with the high risk doctor</h2>
<p>Since I am over 35 <em>(and especially since I will be 40 when I deliver)</em>, I now have a high risk doctor. I met him after today's test. He is great and very data-focused <em>(an attribute I really appreciate)</em>.</p>
<p>If I thought I was living at my doctor's office before, I will <em>really</em> be living there once I am at 32 weeks. I will need to go back for weekly screenings to check on the kiddo's development. Depending on how she's doing, there is a chance I may be forced to deliver early -- even as early as 37 weeks.</p>
<p>But, so far, so good!</p>
