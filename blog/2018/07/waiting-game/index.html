    <p>I am 37 weeks today and the wait is killing me. I know she's coming out soon and I think my belly is starting to drop, but the kiddo has not made her move yet. It seems she's not even close. I mean, even my Braxton-Hicks contractions have toned themselves down.</p>
<p>The kiddo is kicking more, true to her code name (Lord Kick Ass). The kicking is mostly in my ribs (right side only), but I think that is because she is already head down and, frankly, her legs have nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>I am actually pretty torn about the waiting game of these last few weeks. On the one hand, she is so much more portable while she is on the &quot;inside&quot;. On the other hand, I really can't wait to meet this tiny human that has been inside my belly for so long, to see what she's really like in &quot;real life&quot;. (Also, I miss sleeping on my stomach.)</p>
<h2>Q &amp; A time</h2>
<p>I have been getting a lot of questions from friends (and the occasional stranger) now that I am towards the end, so here are some FAQs for you all.</p>
<p><strong>What cravings are you having?</strong></p>
<p>None. Seriously. I think I'm defective.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm totally eating up a storm. I'm just not craving anything in particular.</p>
<p>Except ice. Is that a craving? My ice maker has been working overtime the last couple of months.</p>
<p><strong>Are you about to give birth right here in my living room?</strong></p>
<p>No. I'm pretty sure it doesn't work that way.</p>
<p><strong>You're so active. WTF?</strong></p>
<p>I have no idea. It probably has something to do with the fact that I was running up through week 30-ish. I'm even still working out, for some definition of &quot;working out&quot;. Frankly, I'm just thankful that I'm not a giant blob on the couch. <em>(I know that sounds like heaven to some of you all, but that would be torture for me.)</em></p>
<p><strong>How are you dealing with the massive heat we're having?</strong></p>
<p>Air conditioning. As an introvert, I don't want to leave the house anyway. So... win-win?</p>
<h2>Ready for go time... kinda</h2>
<p>My bags are packed and in the car. Technically <em>(as in, on paper)</em> I am ready for the kiddo to come. Mentally... that is another story. To be honest, childbirth hasn't really hit me yet <em>(though, I'm sure it will soon!)</em>.</p>
