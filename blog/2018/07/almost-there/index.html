    <p>My last high risk appointment was yesterday and my last OB appointment was today. Actually, I should say <em>appointments</em>.</p>
<h2>Today's (last!) OB visit</h2>
<p>I saw my doctor and we had a great conversation about my due date and upcoming induction, during which I learned a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>My cervix is very small.</li>
<li>My belly is very... not small.</li>
<li>The kiddo is very far up my pelvis, meaning she is not ready to make her entrance (or exit, depending on your perspective).</li>
<li>Everything is still closed up anyway.</li>
<li>We are still aiming for a vaginal delivery, but if the kiddo is too big, that will not be feasible.</li>
<li>&quot;Too big&quot; means 9 lb. or over.</li>
<li>Also, the kiddo not only needs to be head-down, but she also needs to be facing my spine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the last time the kiddo was measured was 3 weeks ago <em>(at 6lb.)</em>, so we have no idea how much she weighs right now. So... time for another sonogram!</p>
<h2>Weighing in at...</h2>
<p>As of a couple of hours ago, the kiddo weighs 7 lb. 2 oz. ... give or take 1 lb. I'm not sure how I feel about a 14% margin of error. (I mean... that's a lot of error.) However, since the maximum current weight is still well under that 9 lb. threshold, out the vagina she will go! (For now.)</p>
