    <p>I wanted to update this category in my blog one more time before &quot;signing off&quot;. I could blog all day and night about Amelia, but I also want to keep most aspects of her life private. That means, off Facebook, off Instagram, off whatever other social media platforms exist that I'm &quot;too old&quot; to use, and off this blog. Sorry folks.</p>
<h2>12 Days</h2>
<p>Amelia is 12 days old now. She changes literally every day. I'm excited to see how she will grow and change in the days/weeks/months/years to come, but I am also sad because I miss how she was just a week ago.</p>
<p>I have learned some very important things about myself over the last 12 days. The first is that, before Amelia arrived, I was super OCD about how I kept my house. Now... not so much. I mean, not at <em>all</em>. I'm not saying my house is a train wreck. (Anyone who knows me in real life knows that will <em>never</em> happen.) However, I am less OCD about things like spills. Or random clutter. It's freeing, to be honest.</p>
<p>The second, and more surprising thing, that I've learned is that <strong>OMG I really love babies!</strong> I mean, while I was pregnant, I was <em>dreading</em> the first couple of years of Amelia's life. I've wanted a baby for so long, but I knew absolutely nothing about them: how to feed, how to change a diaper, what they want, etc.</p>
<p>Now that I am in the midst of &quot;newborn central&quot;, I don't want it to end. I love the wide-eyed, open mouthed look that she gives me every so often when we are eating. (This is despite the fact that I have come to learn that is her pooping face. LOL.) I love the baby side-eye that she gives me when I say or do something kinda dumb. I love the almost-smiles I get when I am being silly with her.</p>
<p>I have been taking roughly a million photos of her a day. Videos too, in my fool-hearted attempt to capture these looks accurately. Digital media isn't doing these looks justice, so I'm working on memorizing everything about her.</p>
<p>Amelia will have her own <em>(private, invitation-only)</em> blog <em>(curated by mommy)</em> soon. As I said earlier, in the interest of privacy (assuming people really do read this blog!), this will likely be my last entry about her on this site.</p>
<p>Thank you all for reading! It's been quite the ride since my first entry over a year and a half ago. Feel free to share <a href="/blog/pregnancy/">my pregnancy archive page</a>.</p>
