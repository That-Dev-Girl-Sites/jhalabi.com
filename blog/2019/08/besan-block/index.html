    <p>A few times a year, we hold an internal event at work that we call &quot;Serendipity Day.&quot; We use this day, inspired by <a href="https://npr.codes/serendipity-at-npr-5fb185bb5864">NPR</a>, to work on projects that are somewhat work related, but have been sitting on our back burners for a while. Sometimes we use this day to research a new topic. More often than not, though, we use this day to build something new.</p>
<h2>Serendipity, take 1</h2>
<p>Over a year ago, I decided that for that particular Serendipity Day, I wanted to learn <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a>. I came up with a project to create charts using D3. I intended the project to be an app for developers. A developer could use it to generate SVG code, to be saved and used separately on a site. I was also working with Google's API to get data from spreadsheets there because, well, I needed to get data from <em>somewhere</em>.</p>
<p>After a full day, I was able to learn both Google's API and D3 well enough to produce a single graph. It was great! I learned so much about SVGs as well, because in the process, I also wanted to make these charts accessible. This involved &quot;getting into the weeds&quot; with both SVG code and D3. However, I became very frustrated with D3. The library, while powerful, felt like a whole lot of overhead just to create SVG code.</p>
<p>My intention was to keep working on this project after that Serendipity Day and eventually publish it. Then, life happened and my project remained unpublished.</p>
<h2>Serendipity, take 2</h2>
<p>Fast-forward to Serendipity Day this year. Between that earlier Serendipity Day and now, WordPress 5 was released with its new &quot;Gutenberg&quot; core editor. I am now very well versed in the new editor. I have written more custom post editor blocks than I can count. And that charting project from last year is still in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>So, I decided to rewrite my charting project with some major changes. I decided that feeding data from Google was still a good idea. However, I decided to forego D3 and, instead, write the SVG code manually. I also decided that I wanted this project to be a tool anyone could use. I decided to turn this into a custom block for the WordPress editor.</p>
<p>I created a decent proof of concept in less than a day. My POC was a plugin that added a new post editor block where an editor can enter in a Google Sheets URL and a column of data to chart. WordPress turned that information into a bar chart that was both navigable by keyboard and readable by screen readers. The chart was an SVG created &quot;by hand&quot; in PHP. <em>Success!</em></p>
<p>This time, I was very determined to publish my project because, gosh darn it, this is cool! I found the time to add a settings page to save the editor's Google API key. I added options to add a chart caption and change the colors of the bars. I cleaned up chart styles. I spent <em>way</em> too much time naming this plugin. (<em>Besan</em>, by the way, is the Vulcan word for &quot;chart&quot;. Live long and prosper.)</p>
<h2>OMG. It's happening!</h2>
<p><em>Finally</em>, I submitted my plugin to the WordPress plugin library. <em>And</em> it was accepted! This plugin is officially live.</p>
<p>But, I am not done. I have plans to expand the plugin to include more graphs, starting with pie charts as soon as I sit down and actually work out the math around it. Also scatter plots. And line graphs.</p>
<p>In the meantime, check out the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/besan-block/">Besan Block plugin</a> in all its bar chart glory and have fun!</p>
