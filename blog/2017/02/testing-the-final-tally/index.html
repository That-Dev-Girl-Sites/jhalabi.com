    <p>I am finally (gloriously) done with the testing phase. I actually finished last week, but have been procrastinating writing about it.</p>
<p>Last week was intense between the HSG, an appointment with the counselor, and the final blood work.</p>
<h2>Counseling</h2>
<p>Most, if not all, clinics require patients to have at least one visit with a social worker or psychologist. My doctor made sure to stress that this visit is not a test or a screening. It is simply an additional resource.</p>
<p>The psychologist I saw was very helpful. She had a lot of insight and great advice. However, I found myself leaving with more questions — or rather more homework — than before I saw her. There is a <em>ton</em> of things to think about.</p>
<h3>Where do I get sperm?</h3>
<p>This question is especially complicated because I am currently debating between an anonymous donor and a known donor. <em>(This is a post that I am not ready to write yet.)</em></p>
<p>My biggest takeaways on this topic are that I <em>really</em> need to speak with my potential known donor and figure out what is right for the both of us.</p>
<h3>What <em>is</em> my support system?</h3>
<p>My local support system is woefully sparse. It is something I have always known, but I am constantly questioning whether it is something I am OK with. My closest family member is a 4 hour drive away. I have close friends in the area, but friends are not family.</p>
<p>My biggest takeaway on this topic is that I need to find a support system. Or a support group. I really need to talk to someone who is doing what I am doing.</p>
<p>Two giant questions. Two giant pieces of homework. More on this is (many) future posts, I’m sure.</p>
<h2>Blood work</h2>
<p>For the most part, everything is great. I did encounter a minor, fixable road block — I am not immune to the chicken pox. This is pretty important because if I do get the chicken pox <em>while pregnant</em> (or, rather, shingles), that is really bad news.</p>
<p>The irritating part of this test result is that I was vaccinated for the chicken pox 7 years ago, as an adult. <em>(This story behind this is one for another time.)</em> For whatever reason, that vaccine did not take. My doctor is completely baffled by this.</p>
<p>Regardless, I am getting re-vaccinated. The vaccine consists of 2 shots, 4 weeks apart, with a 1 month hold after the last shot. Therefore, this puts a 2 month hold on starting my treatment, because I cannot get pregnant while taking the vaccine. (Again, chicken pox + fetus = bad.)</p>
<h2>The upside</h2>
<p>Vaccine shot #1 happened today. So, I have 2 months to get all my homework done. Having that time is actually a relief.</p>
