    <p>This is a tale of two fertility clinics. I do not want to use names, so I’ll call them <em>Clinic Alpha</em> and <em>Clinic Beta</em> here.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>My gynecologist referred me to <em>Clinic Alpha first</em>. I had an initial consultation with them last month. <em>Clinic Alpha</em> gave me books and white papers, took blood, and poked at my privates to make sure everything is OK. Thankfully, everything is, in fact, OK. Fantastic!</p>
<p><em>Clinic Alpha</em> and my insurance both confirmed that none of this endeavor would be covered unless I could prove that I have been trying to have a baby for 2 years. Fine. I could accept that.</p>
<p>I asked <em>Clinic Alpha</em> for clarification on what I would need to do from now until conception and how much (roughly) each step would cost. Long story short, that was not a simple answer. It was not a single answer, in fact, and in a couple of cases, the answers I got contradicted each other.</p>
<p>Moreover, I was told that I would have to pay for each step up front — to the point where I could not even speak to anyone but the financial department without paying them something.</p>
<p>I do not want to rant too much, but suffice it to say, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable with <em>Clinic Alpha</em> at this point.</p>
<h2>Getting Started, v2.0</h2>
<p>I called <em>Clinic Beta</em> today. I gave them the brief overview of what I have done so far and my issues with <em>Clinic Alpha</em>. <em>Clinic Beta</em> confirmed that they do take my insurance, but I would need to call my insurance company for the nitty gritty details.</p>
<p>So, back to the insurance company. This time, they told me that, while IVF is definitely not covered under my plan, artificial insemination (IUI) is. In fact, it is covered 100% and in-network doctor visits would end up being billed as specialist visits, in which case I would only have to pay a copay.</p>
<p>Well… that’s different.</p>
<p>That could also work. Assuming my girl parts are as amazing as the <em>Clinic Alpha</em> doctor seems to think they are, all I may need is IUI.</p>
<p>I grilled the (extremely helpful and patient) insurance rep with so many questions and then asked her to send me all of this information to my email, so that I would have a copy of this coverage in writing. (She did.)</p>
<p>Long story short, I can go to <em>Clinic Beta</em> with my initial test results from <em>Clinic Alpha</em> and, ideally, have the rest of this endeavor be covered under insurance.</p>
<p>Of course, this assumes that artificial insemination will work and I will not need to go the IVF route. This plan seems feasible so far, but it’s still very, very early.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Breathe. My financial anxiety has decreased a lot after that second call with the insurance company, and especially now that I have that information in writing.</li>
<li>Call <em>Clinic Alpha</em> to get hard copies of my initial test results from them. That should be an interesting conversation.</li>
<li>Meet with <em>Clinic Beta.</em></li>
<li>Hope the science experiment I am performing on my body all goes to plan. I give this 50/50 odds that we stick to this plan.</li>
</ol>
