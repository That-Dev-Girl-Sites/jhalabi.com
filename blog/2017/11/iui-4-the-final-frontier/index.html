    <p>I am a little bit behind in my blogging here, but I had my 4th IUI last Tuesday, which means as of today, I am 6 dpiui.</p>
<h2>Medication update</h2>
<p>I am on progesterone, which if you were paying attention to my previous post about medications, is that pill you take vaginally. <em>(Again... ugh.)</em></p>
<p>I am happy to report that the pill-taking process is going well, in that I am successfully taking the meds. Funny thing about progesterone: it makes you bleed. This is a common and very expected side effect. This is also not a side effect I am thrilled with. My nurse told me that a panty liner will be sufficient for the bleeding. It is not. While I am not bleeding a ton <em>(it is certainly not enough to fill an entire maxi pad)</em>, I am definitely -- and regularly -- bleeding enough where a liner is not going to cover it.</p>
<p>The good thing about the bleeding is that it starts almost immediately and it is over in under an hour.</p>
<h2>Symptom update</h2>
<p>I believe that the reason why I forgot about posting here for a while is because I have been feeling no symptoms. Well... minimal symptoms.</p>
<p>My symptoms are so minimal that I am not sure if they are symptoms at all:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two nights ago, I was eating a turkey dinner in a mason jar, complete with potatoes, gravy, and cranberry sauce. I love all of these things; however this combination was surprisingly disgusting. I can chalk that up to the recipe.</li>
<li>I have a weird ache in my lower abdomen. No idea what that's about.</li>
<li>I feel almost (but not quite) nauseous every so often. No actual nausea. Most of the time it's gas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are these real symptoms or am I subconsciously working myself up? We'll find out soon, I suppose!</p>
