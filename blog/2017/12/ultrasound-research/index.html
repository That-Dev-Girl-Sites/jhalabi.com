    <p>It occurred to me over the weekend that insurance in this country is kind of dumb and, as a result, a limited number of ultrasounds are likely covered under my insurance plan. So this week I decided to do some research.</p>
<h2>From my insurance provider</h2>
<p>I contacted my insurance company first. In reply, I received a very confusing message that included a lot of legalese (which I am still waiting for my provider to translate into English). However, that message also included the fact that only <strong>one ultrasound per pregnancy</strong> is covered by my plan.</p>
<p>Seriously? <em>One?</em></p>
<p>I already had one ultrasound to confirm the fact that I'm pregnant in the first place? Does this mean I am screwed for the remaining 8 months of my pregnancy?</p>
<p>They did add a provision that other ultrasounds may be covered if they are deemed medically necessary, but they did not define &quot;medically necessary&quot;. I'm hoping that includes the fact that I will be 40 (!!) when this kid is born.</p>
<p>I am waiting for clarification on all of this.</p>
<h2>From my fertility clinic</h2>
<p>I contacted my nurse and the financial office at my fertility clinic in the hopes that they could help me translate the insurance company's reply.</p>
<p>On the up side, they speak &quot;normal average human&quot;.</p>
<p>On the down side, they could not provide more details about what the insurance company was trying to say either.</p>
<p>Back on the up side, they were able to give me real numbers about how much an ultrasound costs. $295. <em>(In my case. YMMV.)</em> That's not terrible. I mean, it's less than half the cost of sperm.</p>
