  <article class="post-article" aria-labelledby="post-title">
    <p>I am now 8 weeks pregnant and just had my first OB appointment today. Everything went smoothly. Pap smear... check! Breast exam... check! Consult with my OB... check! Five vials of blood taken for <strong>all</strong> the tests... check!</p>
<p>I learned today that I am officially high risk, or, as all of the doctors and nurses like to say, at an &quot;advanced maternal age&quot;. I'm going to get out my walker now.</p>
<p>All of that really means that I need to have roughly 523 more appointments and tests before the end of my first trimester.</p>
<h2>Genetic screening</h2>
<p>Because of my &quot;high risk&quot; status, genetic screening is medically necessary, to test for things like Downs Syndrome and Trisomy 18. There are 2 different tests that I can take: one at 10 weeks that tests for those conditions plus a host of other things and one at 12-14 weeks that tests for those conditions plus looks at an ultrasound of the kiddo.</p>
<p>Fortunately, both are covered by my insurance because of my &quot;advanced maternal age.&quot; Age has its perks, kids!</p>
<h2>Heart screening</h2>
<p>I also need to have an EKG because of <em>(you guessed it)</em> my &quot;advanced maternal age.&quot; This I need schedule as soon as possible, so the doctors know if I have any heart conditions that might come into play during delivery. I am a runner (and yes, I am still running, with the doctor's OK for now), so hopefully all will be well here.</p>
<h2>The rest of the kitchen sink</h2>
<p>I also need a glucose test and something called a &quot;24 hour urine test&quot;, which I am really hoping does not involve me peeing for 24 hours straight. <em>(Spoiler: It probably does not.)</em> But those tests don't happen for a while.</p>
