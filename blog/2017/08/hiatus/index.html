    <p>Well, IUI attempt #3 was a bust. I am heartbroken, not just because this failed, but because I honestly thought it was going well.</p>
<h2>I had symptoms.</h2>
<p>I am even pretty sure they were not psychosomatic. There were days when I felt nauseous after eating. Right before AF reared her ugly head, my breasts hurt. I mean, they <em>hurt</em>. That is saying a lot, since in my particular case, there isn't much there <em>to</em> hurt. Even when AF did come, it was different. The first day and a half were very slow, which is not even close to my normal. You could almost say I was more spotting than anything. I honestly thought it was implantation bleeding, at least until it went to full flow.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my body duped me. I'm sure it was all hormones and stress. I have spent the last 3 months strategically putting foreign material into my body. My systems are understandably freaking out.</p>
<h2>So, what's next?</h2>
<p>I am taking a break. I am going overseas on vacation in two months. The thought of trying again with my next (pre-vacation) cycle did occur to me. However my friends, nurse, and random not-exactly-strangers in my online support group all agree that I should wait until after my trip.</p>
<p>Intellectually, I agree.</p>
<p>Emotionally, I feel like a two-month wait means that I will lose momentum, despite the fact that momentum is not a real thing here. However, I have been feeling more symptoms with each attempt. Maybe that means I am getting closer with each try? Also, I am almost 40. Assuming I get pregnant at some point, I will definitely be over 40 when this kid is born. That number bothers me more and more with each passing month.</p>
<h2>Intellect wins the day.</h2>
<p>Regardless of my emotions -- or because of them -- I need the break. These past 3 months have been emotionally exhausting. It's like going for an audition, thinking you nailed it, and then getting a letter in <strong>giant red letters</strong> that says you have been rejected... and then repeating the process over and over again. Just typing that last sentence was exhausting.</p>
<h2>One last thing (for now):</h2>
<p>I received my new protocol for attempt #4. While my last 3 attempts have been with my natural cycle, attempt #4 will feature <em>all</em> the drugs. Well, not really <em>all</em> of them. But I will be on 3 different medications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clomid:</strong> At least that one is oral. It stimulates egg production. I will be on a very low dose, which still increases my chances for multiples. I don't pray, but I am also a one-at-a-time kind of girl, so I may start.</li>
<li><strong>Ovidrel:</strong> The trigger shot.</li>
<li><strong>Prometrium:</strong> A capsule I have to take vaginally. <em>Vaginally</em> How the f#%$ do you take a pill vaginally?!? I mean, I'm sure it's possible, otherwise my doctor would not prescribe that, but... wtf?!</li>
</ul>
<p>See you all in 2 months. If I were you, I would expect a lot more swearing and use of the word &quot;vaginally&quot; here when I come back.</p>
