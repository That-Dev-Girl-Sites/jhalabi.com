There have been a lot of stories in the news about gender issues in the tech world. The [Ellen Pao case](https://slate.com/business/2015/03/ellen-pao-trial-the-lawsuit-brought-awareness-to-workplace-sexism-but-the-setbacks-are-gripping.html). [Gamergate](https://gawker.com/what-is-gamergate-and-why-an-explainer-for-non-geeks-1642909080). The [dongle joke](https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/a-dongle-joke-that-spiraled-way-out-of-control/) at Pycon.  The [gender gap](http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/26/silicon-valley-gender-gap-widening/70444276/) in the tech industry.  The list goes on and on. And now today, an LA Times article came out asking [why women are leaving the tech industry](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-women-tech-20150222-story.html).

I am 100% a woman and 100% a programmer.  And I am not going anywhere.

Of the stories I have been reading about women in tech, many seem to have a sub-theme that we should be able to embrace our techie-ness _and_ our girly-ness.  That it is OK to wear a dress and cute heels, putt makeup on, and fix up my hair.  That this will send a signal that it is OK to be girly and be a tech geek.

And it _is_ OK to be girly and be techie... as long as that is who you actually are.

## My Un-Style

My style is really not.  I have (many, many) days I just want to wear yoga pants and and a tank top and call it good.  If it weren't for corporate dress codes, that outfit would happen way more often.  I also wear, and even (mostly) like, dresses.  But on those days, I also make jokes about how I'm not wearing any pants.

I don't like spending that much time getting ready in the morning because, frankly, I have better things to do.  I don't wear makeup and my hair is always in a ponytail because it is easy.  And while I wear dresses, anyone will tell you that I will happily sit on the floor in that dress as long as I'm pretty sure I won't flash someone.

My first little kid crush was [not even human](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2).  (That has not [changed much](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Tenth_Doctor) as an adult.) I would rather see a sci-fi movie than a romantic comedy.  Although to be honest, I would rather go to a football game than the movies.  I make crude jokes because, every so often, I have the sense of humor of a 13-year old.  I joke about having gone to a boys school because I basically did.  I am more comfortable around guys than I am around girls because I am blunt and (for the most part) so are they.

## Getting back to coding.

I started writing code when I was 7, despite the fact that I grew up in the '80s and that was weird back then.  It was an Apple iiC and I quickly learned that turning it on without a disk would get me to a [BASIC prompt](http://www.landsnail.com/a2ref.htm).  _(You always remember your first.)_  One thing lead to another and now I have been coding professionally for over 15 years.

Most people take me seriously as a programmer, but I still come across some who get weirded out because I "don't look like a programmer."  I look too nice or too put together or too girly.  As though, the programmer uniform somehow still consists of jeans, old t-shirts, mad scientist hair, and no breasts.

I ignore those weirded out people because they don't fit into my life.

I have pretty much constructed my life and career around what feels right.  Yes, that is a little hippie for a programmer, but it has worked well.  If a job feels right, I stay.  If not, I don't.  Same with people.  If a person feels right (friend or otherwise), we stay.  If not... sorry.  Life is too short to act otherwise.

## So... who am I?

I am a woman.  I am a professional geek.  I am girly and not girly at the same time.  I am who I am, quirks and all, and I own every quirk that I have.  And every other geek/nerd/techie/whatever -- female or not -- should do the same.
