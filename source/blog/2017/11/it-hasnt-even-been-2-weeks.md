Today, at 13 dpiui, marks the day before my pregnancy test. I feel nauseous. And dizzy. And I may have my period. Or maybe that's just all the bleeding from the progesterone. Which could explain the dizziness. Or not. How the hell should I know?! Oh, did I mention I'm cranky? And hungry. Oh crap. I forgot that I'm nauseous.
