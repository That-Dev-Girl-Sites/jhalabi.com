excerpt: Well, IUI attempt 3 was a bust.
---

Well, IUI attempt #3 was a bust. I am heartbroken, not just because this failed, but because I honestly thought it was going well.

## I had symptoms.

I am even pretty sure they were not psychosomatic. There were days when I felt nauseous after eating. Right before AF reared her ugly head, my breasts hurt. I mean, they _hurt_. That is saying a lot, since in my particular case, there isn't much there _to_ hurt. Even when AF did come, it was different. The first day and a half were very slow, which is not even close to my normal. You could almost say I was more spotting than anything. I honestly thought it was implantation bleeding, at least until it went to full flow.

Needless to say, my body duped me. I'm sure it was all hormones and stress. I have spent the last 3 months strategically putting foreign material into my body. My systems are understandably freaking out.

## So, what's next?

I am taking a break. I am going overseas on vacation in two months. The thought of trying again with my next (pre-vacation) cycle did occur to me. However my friends, nurse, and random not-exactly-strangers in my online support group all agree that I should wait until after my trip.

Intellectually, I agree.

Emotionally, I feel like a two-month wait means that I will lose momentum, despite the fact that momentum is not a real thing here. However, I have been feeling more symptoms with each attempt. Maybe that means I am getting closer with each try? Also, I am almost 40. Assuming I get pregnant at some point, I will definitely be over 40 when this kid is born. That number bothers me more and more with each passing month.

## Intellect wins the day.

Regardless of my emotions -- or because of them -- I need the break. These past 3 months have been emotionally exhausting. It's like going for an audition, thinking you nailed it, and then getting a letter in **giant red letters** that says you have been rejected... and then repeating the process over and over again. Just typing that last sentence was exhausting.

## One last thing (for now):

I received my new protocol for attempt #4. While my last 3 attempts have been with my natural cycle, attempt #4 will feature _all_ the drugs. Well, not really _all_ of them. But I will be on 3 different medications:

* **Clomid:** At least that one is oral. It stimulates egg production. I will be on a very low dose, which still increases my chances for multiples. I don't pray, but I am also a one-at-a-time kind of girl, so I may start.
* **Ovidrel:** The trigger shot.
* **Prometrium:** A capsule I have to take vaginally. _Vaginally_ How the f#%$ do you take a pill vaginally?!? I mean, I'm sure it's possible, otherwise my doctor would not prescribe that, but... wtf?!

See you all in 2 months. If I were you, I would expect a lot more swearing and use of the word "vaginally" here when I come back.
