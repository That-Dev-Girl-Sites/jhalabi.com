Welcome to day 7!  I have been doing this photo-a-day thing for a whole week... can you believe it?

Anyway, today's photo subject is "your name".  I actually had several ideas in mind for today's pic.  Grabbing a Joni Mitchell CD cover.  Taking a picture of my e-mail signature.  Finding those Winnie the Pooh letter figurines that my mom gave me years ago that spell out my name.  Digging out a personalized Christmas ornament.  Writing my name on a post-it  note.  And then I got hungry....
