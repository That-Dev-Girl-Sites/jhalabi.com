And we're back!  Today's photo subject is "inside your fridge".

I am 99% positive what is inside _your_ fridge is more interesting than what is inside my fridge.  I am single, I have no roommates, and I hate to cook.  So... my fridge is basically condiments, some produce, and a lot of bagels.  (FYI: my freezer is much more interesting.)
