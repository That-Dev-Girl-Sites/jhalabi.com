I just had my 24-week appointment today. All is still well! The kiddo has a heartbeat that is high enough. I have blood pressure that is low enough. I am up 9 pounds from my pre-pregnancy weight. At least it's not 40? _(Yet!)_

I also learned today that, as of this week, the kiddo is officially viable.

## Wait. What?!

Yup. It has only been 24 weeks, yet she could theoretically pop out today and be a fully formed human. Not that it's a good idea for her to do that _(so don't get any ideas, kid!)_, but yikes!

I probably shouldn't be too surprised. I mean, she's kicking and every so often, she kicks in such a way that I can see something trying to poke out from under my belly. And no, she is not trying to recreate that scene from _Alien_. At least, I assume she's not.
