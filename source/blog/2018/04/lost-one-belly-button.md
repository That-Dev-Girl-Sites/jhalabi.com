excerpt: Last seen in the center of my belly.

**Lost:** One small "innie" belly button. Round and relatively symmetrical. Last seen in the center of my belly, perhaps a week ago. Just looked down today and suddenly it was gone.

I would offer a reward for its return, but I suspect it has run away and is not planning to return until later this summer.
