excerpt: I am officially at 13 weeks and firmly in my second trimester.

For _(hopefully)_ obvious privacy reasons, I originally kept all of my pregnancy posts private, especially while I was still trying to conceive and during my first trimester. In reality, very few people knew about any of this.

Now that I am officially at 13 weeks and firmly in my second trimester, I decided it was time to publish these posts. People I know in person know now. Plus, I really am starting to show now.

Before publishing, I read through each post _(and occasionally edited a few)_. During that process, I realized a few things:

1. I am terrible at blogging in a timely manner.
1. Because of #1, I forgot to write updates about a few things. I meant to. I just forgot. Because... #1.

So.. here are some updates:

## Donor sperm

I ultimately chose to use an anonymous donor. No, there is no book of guys. Yes, there is a database of guys. Yes, you can search by (just about) any attribute. Yes, I have a _ton_ of information about this anonymous guy. No, I do not have a photo, because anonymous plus current photo does not work in a world with Google image search.

## EKG

It happened! And I'm normal. As a runner, I was not too surprised, but it's a pretty required test for women giving birth after age 40. (And, I will be 40 in just a few months. Yay?)

## Due date

July 31! A Leo baby. Not that I pay too much attention to the zodiac, but someone pointed it out to me and now it's stuck in my head.

## Baby name

Yes, I picked out a name. No, I'm not telling you.

## Cravings

Yes. All of them. Except candy. If you know anything about me, you'll know that is weird.
