excerpt: A hobbit's eating scheduleis also the perfect eating schedule for a pregnant woman.
---

It has occurred to me over the last several weeks (months) that a [hobbit's eating schedule](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/105209/what-are-hobbits-daily-eating-schedules) is also the perfect eating schedule for a pregnant woman, or at least _this_ pregnant woman. Allow me to demonstrate.

* **Breakfast:** Around 6am. This tends to be something like a small muffin or bagel.
* **Second breakfast:** Around 9am. This is usually eggs or yogurt... or sometimes both.
* **Elevensies:** Around, well, 11am. This is whatever I happen to have at work that is remotely breakfast-looking, so either fruit, a granola bar, or Cheerios.
* **Luncheon:** Around 1pm. I almost always bring something from home, usually leftovers. My leftovers are usually some combination of meat, beans, and veggies. (When I cook, I throw whatever I have into a crockpot with a bunch of spices and hope for the best.) If I don't have leftovers, I make PB&J. _(Don't judge me. It's still delicious.)_
* **Afternoon tea:** Sometime in the afternoon whenever I get hungry again. Since I am still at work, this also tends to be whatever I have at work, so either fruit, peanut butter and crackers, trail mix. Oh, and also tea _(of course)_.
* **Dinner:** Around 7 or 8pm. This varies a lot. See my earlier note about my style of cooking.
* **Supper:** Ok, I really don't eat supper as in the meal you are very likely thinking of right now. But, assuming I'm not already in bed at 9pm, I do eat _something_ again because... hungry. This also varies a lot.
