excerpt: I have more conversations with colleagues that center around my growing belly.
---

Now that I am quite obviously pregnant, I find that I have more conversations with colleagues that center around my growing belly. This is a conversation that I have with someone at least once per day:

**Me:** _(On my way to the restroom.)_

**Well meaning colleague:** _(Standing still.)_ Hello! How is the baby doing?

**Me:** _(Stops.)_ Fine! In fact, she is doing a drum solo on my bladder right now. _(Tries to continue to walk towards the restroom.)_

**WMC:** _(Still standing still.)_ Oh! So you're having a girl!

**Me:** _(Stops again.)_ Yes! I am also about to have an accident. Excuse m...

**WMC:** Girls are so great. I have a (girl/boy/cat/cup of coffee).

**Me:** Yup. I'm super excited... and uncomfortable.

**WMC:** Fantastic! When are you due?

**Me:** In about 30 seconds from now... oh, I mean July 31.

**WMC:** So soon! That must be exciting.

**Me:** _(Mentally says f-it and runs to the restroom.)_

I love all of you well meaning colleagues, but for the love of all that is good in the world, let the pregnant women in your life pee!
