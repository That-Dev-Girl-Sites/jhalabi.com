excerpt: Today, I received a unique business opportunity in my inbox.
---

My email box is almost always full of messages from friends, colleagues, newsletters, and the not-so-occasional spammers. I strive for inbox zero, but somehow rarely achieve it. However, I do make a regular effort to check, read, sort, and sometimes even respond to the emails I receive.

Today, I received a unique business opportunity in my inbox. The subject line read:

> [Confidential] Ever Considered Selling Georgetown University?

Why no, Mr. Bond[^1], I had not considered selling the university I work for and in no way actually own. However, it *is* important to keep an open mind about such well-thought-out business opportunities.

The biggest question is, should I sell the university as one single entity? Or, should I consider splitting it up to sell in parts? The football team could become its own NFL franchise[^2]. The library has a strong potential to become a vintage bookstore and coffee shop. The Law School could spin off into its own top-tier law firm, emphasizing on-the-job learning. The nursing and medical schools can wholly merge with the hospital as its own succinct entity.

However, there are complications to this plan. Alumni get a bit touchy when their alma mater disappears into the ether of capitalism. Students might revolt against the idea of their beacon of higher education being turned into a series of ad-hoc start ups. Not to mention the issues of identity and name recognition. And, of course, the small detail that I am not the actual owner of this, or any, university.

So, Mr. Bond[^3], while I have given your kind, and no longer confidential, offer serious consideration, I fear I must decline it at this time. However, I remain open to other business opportunities, strategic partnerships, and ideas that begin with the phrase “surprisingly legal ways to….”[^4]




[^1]: Yes, that is the sender’s actual name. Another gem.
[^2]: I know there is a difference between college and professional football. However, there are no college football teams that are unaffiliated with an institution of higher learning. Therefore, the NFL is the most logical new home. Don’t @ me.
[^3]: Seriously, I feel like I should be petting a cat every time I type that name.
[^4]: In case this is not obvious, this entire article is satire. That is all.
