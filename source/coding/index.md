<section markdown="1" class="coding-intro" aria-label="Introduction">

As a website creator and self-appointed “middle-end” developer, I enjoy creating accessible web-based narratives, developing custom code to support my storytelling, and making up my own titles. My development career has evolved over a wide range of industries, including e-commerce, non-profit, and education. 

In my more recent development projects, I specialized in content architecture and WordPress editor customizations. As a developer at [Georgetown University](https://georgetown.edu), I wrote over 50 custom WordPress blocks, using ReactJS, PHP, and the Gutenberg API.

I recently made the decision to take a step back from full-time coding, in order to make space for other professional and personal priorities. That being said, I still [write technical articles](/blog/) about my work and [speak](/speaking/) at the occasional technical conference or podcast.
