<section markdown="1" class="coding-intro" aria-label="Introduction">

In 2024, I made the decision to take a step back from full-time web developement, in order to make space for other professional and personal priorities. 

Prior to that shift, I worked as a self-appointed "middle-end" developer, specializing in content architecture and WordPress editor customizations. My development career evolved over a wide range of industries, including e-commerce, non-profit, and education. While I was a developer at [Georgetown University](https://georgetown.edu), I wrote numerous WordPress themes and plugins, as well as over 50 custom Gutenberg blocks, using ReactJS, PHP, and the Gutenberg API.

Today, I enjoy creating accessible web-based narratives, developing custom code to support my storytelling. I also [write technical articles](/blog/) about my work and [speak](/speaking/) at technical conferences and podcasts.
