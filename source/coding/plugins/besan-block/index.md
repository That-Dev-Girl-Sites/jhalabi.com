## Features

This plugin adds a custom block to the WordPress post editor that displays a responsive and accessibly data chart on your site. The chart uses the Google API to read data from a publicly available Google Sheet, allowing for changes to the data to be reflected on your website in real time.

The chart is drawn as a SVG, making it both responsive and accessible. Content editors can also cusomize the chart color to fit the site theme.

The block currently supports vertical and horizontal bar charts. More charting options are planned for the future.
