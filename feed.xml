      <title>Can we use AI to test alt text?</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OpenAI announced its &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/index/new-chatgpt-images-is-here/&quot;&gt;new model for creating images in ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. This model promises more accurate, more detailed, and faster image generation, not only for transforming one image into another, but also for creating completely original images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use ChatGPT to create fun images, mostly based on my daughter’s imagination. As I read OpenAI’s announcement, thinking of new images to ask it to create, I couldn’t help but wonder, &lt;em&gt;can a well-crafted image creation prompt also serve as the alt text for that image?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used ChatGPT’s new image model to create an image based on the following prompt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartoon-styled image of a creature who is a unicorn with wings and a mermaid tail, standing in rainbow-colored field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT created this image in just a couple of minutes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/assets/images/posts/alicorn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AI-generated, cartoon-styled image of a creature who is a unicorn with wings and a mermaid tail, standing in a field filled with rainbow-colored flowers. There is a rainbow in the bright blue sky above her.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative text, or alt text, is text that describes the content on an image. It is a substitute, used by people who are unable to see the image itself for any reason. This image definitely describes my prompt&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Cartoon style. Unicorn with wings and a mermaid tail.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Rainbow colored field. The field &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; filled with rainbow-colored flowers, a detail not included in my prompt, but the field is still rainbow. Also, the creature is floating, not standing, because how does one stand when they have a mermaid tail and &lt;em&gt;no legs&lt;/em&gt;? I did not think that one through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A new test for alt text?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating the image above brought up another, related question: &lt;em&gt;Can AI be used to test the veracity of an image’s alt text?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to test this question by using alt text as a prompt to create a new image using ChatGPT’s new image model. Would the generated image be similar to the original?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test #1: Christmas-themed image from Pexels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pexels is a free stock image library that is used by developers and designers for a variety of reasons. This first test is of a holiday themed image that was featured on the front page, with the following alt text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A festive living room featuring a beautifully decorated Christmas tree and cozy fireplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pexels.com/photo/cozy-christmas-living-room-with-decorated-tree-35148259/&quot;&gt;original photo&lt;/a&gt; vs. the generated photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/assets/images/posts/test-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Original image of a festive living room featuring a beautifully decorated Christmas tree and cozy fireplace.&quot;&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/assets/images/posts/test-1-results.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AI-generated image of a festive living room featuring a beautifully decorated Christmas tree and cozy fireplace.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The images are similar in structure, though not in details. The AI-generated image is far more detailed, festive, and, in my opinion, blows “cozy” out of the water. The original alt text could certainly be better, but it is not awful and gets the job done in the simplest way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; The original alt text could be better, but it is passable and describes the image in the simplest way possible.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test #2: A stock image featuring people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this test, I was curious to see how a photo with people would fare. Again, I used a stock image from Pexels, with the following alt text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stylish couple posing confidently at a formal event against a vibrant red backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pexels.com/photo/elegant-couple-at-formal-event-with-red-backdrop-35217083/&quot;&gt;original photo&lt;/a&gt; vs. the generated photo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/assets/images/posts/test-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Original image of a stylish couple posing confidently at a formal event against a vibrant red backdrop.&quot;&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/assets/images/posts/test-2-results.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AI-generated image of a stylish couple posing confidently at a formal event against a vibrant red backdrop.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These images are again similar in structure, but are obviously very different people wearing very different clothes. In this case, the alt text is iffy and context-dependent. If this image were to be used on a real site, does race matter? Does gender? Are the clothes relevant? These questions are all opinion based and contextual questions that only a human can answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; This alt text needs further review by a human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test #3: A real-world image&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This third test is one from a page on a live site, instead of a stock image library. I work for Georgetown and love books, so for this experiment, I chose the featured image for a recent article titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.georgetown.edu/news/12-books-professors-recommend-but-dont-require-you-read-this-winter/&quot;&gt;12 Books Professors Recommend (But Don’t Require) You Read This Winter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The image has the following alt text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stack of books on a windowsill next to a plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original photo vs. the generated photo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/assets/images/posts/test-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Original image of a stack of books on a windowsill next to a plant.&quot;&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/assets/images/posts/test-3-results.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AI-generated image of a stack of books on a windowsill next to a plant.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, not bad. There are books. There is a plant. Everything is on a windowsill. Even the natural lighting is similar. The AI-generated photo is different in terms of the number of books and the details on the books. The original image includes real books with visible titles, but the generated image does not, because that was not included in the prompt. This could be an issue if the specific titles were relevant to the context, but for this particular article, they are not. The same could be said for the glasses on top of the stack of photos in the AI generated image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; This alt text is pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Test #4: An image with what seems to be terrible alt text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this fourth, and final (for now), test, I decided to test an image whose alt text does not seem (to me) to properly describe the image. For this experiment, I chose an image from a news article about &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.rpi.edu/2025/11/12/five-million-airbnb-reviews-illuminate-guests-crime-and-safety-concerns&quot;&gt;Airbnb reviews and safety concerns&lt;/a&gt;, published by RPI (my alma mater). The image has the following alt text:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keys for short-term rental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original photo&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; vs. the generated photo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/assets/images/posts/test-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Original image of a person accessing the keys from a lock box on an exterior wall.&quot;&gt;. &lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/assets/images/posts/test-4-results.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AI-generated image of a set of keys on a key chain that reads short-term rental, sitting on a wooden table.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both pictures have keys. That is where the similarities end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; The photo is more decorative in context, so more detailed alt text is not strictly necessary. However, if the image content were relevant to the news story, this alt text is not descriptive enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-written alt text is crucial to the users who rely on it. However, the context of how the image is used is an important consideration when writing alt text. The description of the image can be less detailed or focus on a single aspect of the image, depending on the intent of both the image and the page in which it lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there is no single test or absolute right answer to the question of alt text for an image. The answer is my least favorite answer: &lt;em&gt;it depends&lt;/em&gt;. For questions whose answers rely on judgement calls, AI is not the best tool. Crafting – and testing – alt text is still a fundamentally human job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Describes my prompt” is an understatement. My kid is going to scream (literally and from joy) when she sees this. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creature is called an &lt;em&gt;alumer&lt;/em&gt;. The name is a combination of “alicorn”, a winged horse with a horn, and “mermaid.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The generated image is also way better. Sorry / not sorry. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will also be making note of these books after I finish the &lt;em&gt;giant&lt;/em&gt; pile of books that are currently next to my desk. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original image is credited to Getty Images. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/12/ai-to-test-alt-text/#fnref5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>WordPress bans: A story about caring</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/05/wordpress-and-caring/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got an email from &lt;a href=&quot;http://WordPress.org&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are writing to inform you that your &lt;a href=&quot;http://WordPress.org&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; and Slack accounts have been unblocked following a recent review. This review was conducted as part of our continuous efforts to maintain a healthy and inclusive community where everyone is treated fairly and can engage positively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed. My WordPress Slack account was blocked in October 2024. I almost exclusively lurked in that Slack, sending the occasional private message. Despite that, I know what I did. I clicked a &amp;quot;thumbs-down&amp;quot; emoji as a reaction to one of Matt&#39;s messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which one? No idea. It could have been any number of messages. For nearly a year, so many of them have been un-hinged nonsense. So, for the sake of guessing, it was something posted last October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I learned from the ban&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. That is not entirely true. What is true is that I did not care. I sent WordPress an email to ask what happened, solely because I was in the middle of a DM conversation with someone. The ban interrupted us. Otherwise, who cares? I deleted that workspace from my Slack app and forgot about the whole thing. That is, until yesterday&#39;s email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to what I &lt;em&gt;learned&lt;/em&gt;. I learned that I do not care about WordPress. At least, not as a technology. That surprised me, because up until very recently, I loved WordPress. It consumed nearly all of my development life. I customized Gutenberg blocks and the post editor in general at work. I published &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/thatdevgirl/&quot;&gt;custom plugins&lt;/a&gt; outside of work. I spoke at conferences about the cool &lt;em&gt;(and occasionally weird)&lt;/em&gt; things I did with WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But right now, I happen to be at a turning point in my career. I was burnt out as a developer and needed something to change. After a lengthy search, I landed in my current role. This role mostly consists of researching and writing stories, and making those stories engaging and accessible. The fact that I know how to write code comes in handy, but it is no longer the focus of my career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This career shift has been a breath of fresh air. Air that made me realize something important, between this new focus at work and everything that is happening in the WordPress universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can tell these stories anywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Choices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current employer primarily uses WordPress. Whether or not that will ever change is not something I have either knowledge of or power over. &lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt;, theoretically, I can do my core job using anything. Wordpress. Drupal. Static HTML and CSS. Paper and crayons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, maybe not that last one, but you get the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress, along with every other CMS, is a means to an end. The goal is to create a manageable and beautiful website that engages users in whatever way makes sense.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/05/wordpress-and-caring/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Sometimes, WordPress is the best choice. Sometimes, something else is best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to realize that WordPress is not the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; choice. For many, WordPress is the only choice by default, because we have lived in the WordPress universe for a long time. It can be hard to think about anything else. WordPress becomes comfortable. You just get used to it, like the pile of pillows in the middle of your living room that your 6 year-old stacked one day and declared it to be her spot.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/05/wordpress-and-caring/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, I have to adhere to the platform that my organization uses and that is WordPress. However, in a vacuum, I don&#39;t know if I would make the same choice. Because...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can tell these stories anywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can research, write, and engage on any platform. That is a privilege I have, largely because of my background. As a developer – even one who has spent so much time with WordPress – I have the skills to create web content on something that is not WordPress. I can publish using another CMS. Or I can opt to not use a CMS at all and create a static site.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/05/wordpress-and-caring/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This privilege lets me critically think about whether or not I care about using WordPress. I can honestly say I do not.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/05/wordpress-and-caring/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That realization makes me sad, because I loved WordPress up until late last year. I still have a nostalgic soft spot for its technology. I grew more than I imagined as a developer over the last 9 years. I have &lt;em&gt;stories&lt;/em&gt; about using Gutenberg, even before WordPress 5.0 was released, but that is extremely off-topic here. However, I am at a point where I am &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/10/an-open-letter-about-wordpress-and-energy/&quot;&gt;tired of drama and WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, at least the leadership, is not helping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, thank you WordPress for unblocking me, but it never really mattered anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I highly recommend Chris Reynolds&#39; article &lt;a href=&quot;https://jazzsequence.com/2025/05/what-does-it-feel-like-to-be-banned-from-wordpress-ill-tell-you/&quot;&gt;What does it feel like to be banned from WordPress? I’ll tell you
&lt;/a&gt;, which inspired me to write this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Whatever way makes sense&amp;quot; is largely open to interpretation. Define it however you want. The world is your oyster! But please, do not use the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blink&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/05/wordpress-and-caring/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may or may not be based on a true story. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/05/wordpress-and-caring/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like this site! My personal site was on WordPress many years ago. I do not remember when I migrated it to Jekyll. It happened because I was tired of paying for WordPress hosting and realized that I can host a Jekyll site for free using Github pages. And &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; I migrated the site to Eleventy because I wanted to learn that system. Long story short, I highly recommend using your personal site to play with new tech. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/05/wordpress-and-caring/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I do care about the friends I made along the way because I started using WordPress. Those communities are truly the best! &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/05/wordpress-and-caring/#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Dear book authors: Please exist and not be AI.</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/05/ai-books/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I trust books. At least, I used to. I grew up in the pre-internet era of bookshops and libraries. The printed word was the best source of information. Back then, there was an inherent trust that a book earned by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today&#39;s internet-heavy, AI-infused world. A (large) part of me still wants to believe in the credence of a published book, at least the non-fiction books. These books are supposed to come from fact-checked, credible sources. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it funny that I still have this level of trust today, given the lack of trust I have elsewhere. When my phone rings, I immediately assume it is spam. When I get an unexpected email, I pour through the message headers and hover over links for clues to prove whether it is safe. When I am on social media, well... let&#39;s not go there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also true that there are some books which break trust. James Frey&#39;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1241.A_Million_Little_Pieces&quot;&gt;A Million Little Pieces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; immediately comes to mind. Originally published as a memoir, this book was rebranded as semi-fiction after the author admitted to embellishing significant parts of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite examples like this and my near-immediate distrust of a good part of the internet, my trust in books has remained steady.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article from the Guardian titled &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/04/dangerous-nonsense-ai-authored-books-about-adhd-for-sale-on-amazon&quot;&gt;‘Dangerous nonsense’: AI-authored books about ADHD for sale on Amazon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; The title immediately struck a nerve because, for a variety of personal reasons, I happen to be reading more about ADHD. So far, my reading list has been limited to recommendations from a trusted doctor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now, I need to worry about AI authors?! I did some research into the authors of the books listed in article. One has profile photo; another&#39;s photo is obviously AI-generated. No author&#39;s bio has any specific information about their credentials or experience. Googling these authors provides no further information. No website. No press releases. No media at all. As a real-live human author, that is unfathomable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a sizeable dent in my default trust of books. And gaining trust is hard. An author of a credible work needs to have credentials in the subject they write about. They need to do their research. Their work needs to be reviewed. But, first and foremost, the author needs to &lt;strong&gt;exist in real life&lt;/strong&gt;. It is truly sad that is no longer a given.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WordPress image permalinks: Not the cat&#39;s meow</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/03/media-library-cleanup/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am in the middle of a big project at work and decided to create a new section of our site for it. I can&#39;t talk about the project (yet!), but let&#39;s pretend it is about cats &lt;em&gt;(the animal, not the musical)&lt;/em&gt;.  I want its URL to be short and simple, so I decided to call it &lt;code&gt;mysite.org/cats&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created the main landing page, clicked &amp;quot;Publish&amp;quot;, and went to my new URL: &lt;code&gt;mysite.org/cats-2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that is not what I wanted. What is &lt;code&gt;cats-2&lt;/code&gt; all about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was fairly confident &lt;code&gt;mysite.org/cats&lt;/code&gt; did not already exist, and to prove it, I went there. And there I went, straight through a redirect that took me to &lt;code&gt;mysite.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/584/2018/12/cats.jpg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/cats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A white cat with blue eyes leans over a brown and black spotted furry ledge and looks off into the distance, possibly contemplating the meaning of life.&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awww..! What a cutie.. I mean, how did I end up here?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How can I fix this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I inherited this site and recently did a massive page clean up. Because of that reorganization project, I know this site inside and out. I would swear on my mother&#39;s cat&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/03/media-library-cleanup/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; that this photo is not used on any pages. Additionally, I theorized that if I remove the photo, that would also automatically remove the redirect, thereby freeing up &lt;code&gt;mysite.org/cats&lt;/code&gt; for my project.  But, I needed to prove that &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; removing the photo, just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plugins that are built to clean up and organize the media library. This article is not about any of those plugins. I have tested none of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I discovered this neat trick&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/03/media-library-cleanup/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in the WordPress list of posts page in the admin. We have all seen the search box above the list of posts, that will let you search for a page by keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/search-pages.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A text box with a button labelled Search Pages next to it, creating a small search form. This form is directly above a set of pagination buttons for the list of posts page&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, &lt;strong&gt;did you know&lt;/strong&gt; you can also use that form to search for images inside a post? It&#39;s simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type (or paste) the file name of the image you are searching for; e.g. &amp;quot;cats.jpg&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the &amp;quot;search&amp;quot; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it! If that search yields results, that image is being used. If the search yields &lt;em&gt;no results&lt;/em&gt;, your image is not being used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Important caveat!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This search will &lt;em&gt;(obviously)&lt;/em&gt; only search a single post type. You will need to individually search for your image on the list of post pages for posts, pages, and any other custom post types that are defined on your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that the number of post types on your site is likely a small number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, &lt;code&gt;cats.jpg&lt;/code&gt; was not being used on any of my pages or posts, so I could safely remove the image. Also, my original theory was correct. Removing the image also removed the redirect. I edited the permalink to my landing page, changing it from &lt;code&gt;cats-2&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;cats&lt;/code&gt;. After saving my page, my URL was as it should be: &lt;code&gt;mysite.org/cats&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What if I needed this photo?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every file in the media library is automatically given its own slug, which by default is simply the name of the file (minus extension). That slug is used for the file&#39;s permalink, but it can also be edited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the file in question in the media library and click on it. It will open in a large pop up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the very bottom of that pop-up, click on the &amp;quot;Edit more details link. This will open the file in its own page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the top of this page, you will see the file&#39;s permalink, but no way to edit it. The option to edit the permalink is hidden away under &amp;quot;Screen options&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open &amp;quot;Screen options&amp;quot; (at the very top of the page). Under &amp;quot;Screen elements&amp;quot; make sure &amp;quot;Slug&amp;quot; has a checkmark next to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll down to almost the bottom of the page. You will now see a section labeled &amp;quot;Slug&amp;quot;, with the file slug in an editable text field. Change the slug to whatever you want. (This will not change the file name, so links to the file are safe.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll back up to the top of the page and click &amp;quot;Update&amp;quot; to save your changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This foray into WordPress media and permalinks has been brought to you by my stubbornness over a URL. May it be as interesting for you as it was for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plot twist. My mother does not now, nor has she ever owned a cat. But I was still really, really sure. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/03/media-library-cleanup/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article is also not one of those &amp;quot;one weird trick&amp;quot; click-bait articles that were &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; once upon a time. Or, at least, it&#39;s not trying to be. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2025/03/media-library-cleanup/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Red flag story time</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/12/red-flags/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s talk about red flags for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen many over the course of my career. One in particular that comes to mind is an interview I had several years ago. The interview was with a larger organization who was hiring for several open developer positions. As I walked into the office, I saw a flurry of people going here and there. One escorted me to an office, where I waited until a very hurried individual came in. She introduced herself as the hiring manager and announced that she did not really have time to interview me. After rushing through a few questions, she left. I showed myself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rejected the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said no because that level of chaos and disorganization screamed at me to run far away. Everything about that interview felt unstable, and I knew that was not an environment I wanted to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel the same way about WordPress today. I have been watching the drama between WordPress and WPEngine unfold over the last several months with a combination of concern and bewilderment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&#39;t recap all of the pieces of this drama, but one of the weirder pieces was the &amp;quot;alliance&amp;quot; login checkbox, where users had to pledge that they were not affiliated with WPEngine in order to log into &lt;a href=&quot;http://WordPress.org&quot;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I (and the rest of the WordPress community) discovered that WordPress took down that checkbox (as ordered by a judge), and replaced it with a new checkbox. Now, users need to assert that &amp;quot;pineapple is delicious on pizza.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/wordpress-pineapple.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Wordpress.org login screen, with the user name and password fields filled in, but redacted. Below the form is a checkbox with the label Pineapple is delicious on pizza. It is unchecked, and has an error message saying please check this box if you want to proceed.&quot; width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this does not scream instability, I don&#39;t know what does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the fact that I cannot stand pineapple on pizza (please don&#39;t @ me), this is the biggest and most public red flag I have ever seen. And I am more concerned and bewildered than I was before.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An open letter about WordPress and energy</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/10/an-open-letter-about-wordpress-and-energy/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Matt,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am tired. This is not the kind of tired that a good night&#39;s sleep will solve. This kind of tired stems from having too much on my plate -- both good and terrible. I started a new role at work that I am beyond excited about. &lt;em&gt;(Good.)&lt;/em&gt; I am a single parent to an amazing 6 year-old. &lt;em&gt;(Really good.)&lt;/em&gt; As for the terrible, they are personal things that I will only share privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combination of good and terrible things take up my space, time, and energy. Actually, let me correct that. They take up &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; my space, time, and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are relevant to my professional space. My current professional life is linked to WordPress. I love WordPress. I love Gutenberg.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/10/an-open-letter-about-wordpress-and-energy/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I write &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/coding/&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/a&gt; that live in Plugin Directory. Most of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/speaking/&quot;&gt;presentations&lt;/a&gt; center around WordPress, be it developing blocks, writing accessible markup, or discussing the latest updates to Gutenberg. I have friends within the WordPress community -- friends I otherwise would never have met. I even &lt;em&gt;(somewhat accidentally)&lt;/em&gt; started the push within my current organization to migrate our 400+ sites from a different CMS into WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no regrets about my ties to WordPress. It is a solid system that I love creating with and developing for. You could even make the argument that I &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;do not need&lt;/em&gt; is for the leader of WordPress to go off the rails in some &lt;em&gt;(seemingly personal)&lt;/em&gt; battle that has only succeeded in creating uncertainty and distrust in the larger WordPress community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I appreciate the need to protect the WordPress name. I really do! I have had my own share of copyright issues. I have needed to send cease-and-desist letters to people selling my &lt;em&gt;(otherwise free)&lt;/em&gt; written works. That is never fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a difference between defending your intellectual property and setting half the internet on fire.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/10/an-open-letter-about-wordpress-and-energy/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Prior to last month, I was never concerned about the future of WordPress. I never had a reason to be. Now, I do. This goes back to my space, time, and energy problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should not have to make space in my life to worry about the damage being done to WordPress and our community. I should not have to spend time losing trust in a system that I have worked in for years. I should not have to spend energy watching a grown adult have more meltdowns than my literal child.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/10/an-open-letter-about-wordpress-and-energy/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I &lt;em&gt;do not&lt;/em&gt; have the space, time, or energy for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am tired. And angry. And extremely disappointed. This is not the behavior of a leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected better from you, and it is definitely time for a time out. Go sit in a corner and think about what you&#39;ve done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, &lt;br&gt;
An exhausted code mom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is liking Gutenberg still controversial? Whatever. I meant what I said. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/10/an-open-letter-about-wordpress-and-energy/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I will not rehash the entire battle &lt;em&gt;(to date)&lt;/em&gt;. Some great resources on the subject already exist. I really like &lt;a href=&quot;https://wpvswpe.report/&quot;&gt;one resource in particular&lt;/a&gt;, but I am sure there are others. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/10/an-open-letter-about-wordpress-and-energy/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My kid is great and, at 6, has far fewer meltdowns than she did at 3. However, she &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a kid and the occasional meltdown is expected. I expect more emotional maturity from adults. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/10/an-open-letter-about-wordpress-and-energy/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>A few words about words</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/08/a-few-words-about-words/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Naming things is hard. As a developer, finding the right name for a function is sometimes harder than writing the function itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name has to be descriptive, so the purpose of the function is obvious. However the name cannot be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; descriptive, because that will make the name too long. Nor can the name be too similar to other functions inside its system, because that will cause confusion. The name needs to be memorable, but not too clever, because clever names border on silliness. The name needs to have longevity, because odds are this function will be used for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More names, more problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, we have built a complex system of themes, plugins, and blocks on top of WordPress. We have complex needs, building a variety of content-creation options for our nearly 400 websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This complexity has extended from our code into our every day language. WordPress has &lt;strong&gt;blocks&lt;/strong&gt;, or distinct content elements. We can use blocks to make a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;block pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or a collection of blocks in a specific layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also create a &lt;strong&gt;reusable block&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a block or set of blocks that are pre-filled with specific content, which can be added to any page. This was renamed in WordPress 6.3 and is now called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reusable-blocks/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;synced pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;(Despite the fact that it uses blocks, this is still different from the block pattern.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to patterns, we can also create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-templates/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;block template&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is a pre-set collection of blocks in a specific order and may or may not include placeholder content. Generally, block templates are used as a set of child blocks in a parent block. &lt;em&gt;(Again, this is different from either of the patterns noted above.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The block template is not to be confused with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-files/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;theme templates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These are the files that are used by a theme to define the look for a particular type of page. Here, there is a difference between the basic template files used by a theme and page templates, which provides layout options for static pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun fact:&lt;/strong&gt; The words “pattern” and “template” are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/pattern&quot;&gt;synonyms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Words cannot be siloed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the term “pattern” in two different contexts above, but those contexts only apply to the development side of WordPress. In working with designers, the word “pattern” is also heavily used in design systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can have a &lt;strong&gt;pattern library&lt;/strong&gt;, or a repository of all design elements and how they work together to create a complete website. The elements of the library can be broken up into smaller bits, that can be called elements… or blocks, or templates, or patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bits can also be called &lt;strong&gt;components&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a term also used in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/components/&quot;&gt;Block API&lt;/a&gt; to define the elements that a block developer can use to construct the block interface in the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t get me started on the editor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “editor” is similarly problematic. We have the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-block-editor/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;block editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is where a human can create pages or posts. This is also called the &lt;strong&gt;WordPress editor&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Gutenberg editor&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;post editor&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on who you are talking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block developers also frequently use the word “editor” to talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-edit-save/&quot;&gt;edit UI&lt;/a&gt; of a single specific block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what about that human? In many circles, they are called the &lt;strong&gt;content editor&lt;/strong&gt;. There is even an &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/#editor&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;editor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; user role in WordPress permissions hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If I were a terrible person…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, I could say the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want the editor to go to the editor and create a page with this template. The page content needs this template with that pattern and that other synced pattern.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sentence has meaning, where each mention of “editor”, &amp;quot;template”, and “pattern” means something different. Fun, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am picking on WordPress a bit here, but this situation could exist for any large-scale complex system. I have a few takeaways from this experience:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Words matter. More importantly, &lt;em&gt;definitions&lt;/em&gt; matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unique concepts require unique words. The alternative creates confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important for everyone in your circle to use the same words for the same concept. The alternative here also creates confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck, and may this block of text be a template for any future patterns you create.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Perseverance: A lesson from my 5 year-old</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/02/perseverance/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My daughter takes taekwondo. Her belt test was last night, where she was aiming to earn her orange belt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test started with warm-ups and a specific sequence of moves. She and her classmates have been practicing this for the last couple of months. She was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test ended with each student breaking a board in front of the class. At her level, she needed to kick the board to break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, some context: My child is 5. Her balance on one foot could use some work. Her kicks are on the more gentle side. This was the part of the test that she (and I!) was nervous about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it was her turn to break the board, she walked to the front of the class. She faces her instructor. She bowed. “Focus, sir! Confidence, sir!” she yelled. And then, she kicked. She touched the board, but it did not break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She kicked again. And again. And again. And again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board did not break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was asked to take a break and give her foot a rest. She sat down, facing the front, which means her back was to the parent audience. I could still see she was not happy. Surprisingly, she did not cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the test, she got another chance to break the board. “Focus, sir! Confidence, sir!” She kicked. A small strip of the board broke off. Some of us giggle, but she is beaming. She broke the board!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was by far the hardest board breaking she has ever experienced and many parents had ever seen. She knows she wasn’t the best, but she kept trying and trying and, in the end, she succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a 5 year-old can maintain that kind of perseverance, so can an adult. Sometimes, things don’t work out the first time. But, if you don’t give up, eventually, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; break that board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/orange-belt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A broken board sits on top of a table. The larger part of the board is standing up (propped up). In front of it is a folded, orange taekwondo belt. Leaning on the belt is the much smaller part of the broken board.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I am super proud of my kid!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git reversions by tag: a much better way</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/git-revert-a-better-way/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Almost a year ago, I published an article about what could be described as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/04git-reversions-by-tag&quot;&gt;worst way to revert tags in git&lt;/a&gt;. I regret that article. The process I outlined there was an experiment gone awry. I conclude the post by telling my readers to &amp;quot;use the knowledge here at your own risk.&amp;quot; I hope you all listened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am bringing this up because I was recently put into a situation (&lt;em&gt;again&lt;/em&gt;) where I needed to revert a git repository back to a specific tag. This is not a task I do often, so off to the internet I went, entering the keywords &amp;quot;git revert by tag&amp;quot; into the search bar. This unearthed my previous post.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/git-revert-a-better-way/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This is promising?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completely forgot about this post and, at first, was very excited. That is, until I actually &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; the entire post. I was disappointed, but determined to find a better way. The other top search results were not the step-by-step tutorial that I was hoping for, but, eventually, I found a method that I am much happier with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The current state of my repo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to revert my repo to a previous tag, but, unlike last year&#39;s &amp;quot;solution&amp;quot;, not destroy any commits along the way. The &lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt; looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;11111 (HEAD -&amp;gt; main, tag: LatestTag) Latest commit
22222 Another fun feature
33333 Fun feature
44444 (tag: PreviousTag) More changes
55555 Random changes
66666 (tag: MuchOlderTag) Changes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The log starts with the most recent commit and goes backwards in time. My most recent commit was tagged (&lt;code&gt;LatestTag&lt;/code&gt;), but I needed to revert this repo back to an older tag -- &lt;code&gt;PreviousTag&lt;/code&gt;. This change would revert 3 commits: &lt;code&gt;11111&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;22222&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;33333&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/git-revert-a-better-way/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Revert the repo locally&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first step is to revert the repo locally to its state at the &lt;code&gt;PreviousTag&lt;/code&gt; tag by rolling each commit back &lt;em&gt;separately&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;git revert HEAD..PreviousTag
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A confirmation of each commit&#39;s reversion appears as part of this &lt;code&gt;revert&lt;/code&gt; command. Git treats each reversion as its own commit, so you will need to review and save each commit as they pop up on your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a chance that some merge conflicts will arise. I did not encounter that, but if you do, use whatever method you usually use to resolve conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once git has finished rolling back each commit, a &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt; looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;[main 33333a] Revert &amp;quot;Fun feature&amp;quot;
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
[main 22222a] Revert &amp;quot;Another fun feature&amp;quot;
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
[main 11111a] Revert &amp;quot;Latest commit&amp;quot;
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three changes were reverted, resulting in three, separate commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Verify and push&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reverting one commit can be daunting. Reverting &lt;em&gt;multiple&lt;/em&gt; commits is a big deal. I cannot stress this enough: Test your code before doing anything else!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have verified that that your code works as expected, push the changes to remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;git push origin main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Goal achieved!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only has the repo been reverted to its previous commit, but the commit history has been preserved &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; each reversion is saved as a separate commit &lt;em&gt;(just in case you need to do more &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; things with git)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, do yourself a favor and forget about last year&#39;s post.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/git-revert-a-better-way/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My post was the third link on the search results page. &lt;em&gt;Third.&lt;/em&gt; That is either embarassing or pretty amazing SEO. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/git-revert-a-better-way/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commit hashes were (obviously) changed to something easier to read, so no one gets lost in a sea of characters. At the very least, this is easier on my eyes. You&#39;re welcome. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/git-revert-a-better-way/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One may ask why I don&#39;t just delete that old post. I don&#39;t really believe in deleting my old content (unless it is truly harmful). That old post is not a great idea, but I also admit that in the post, so I hope readers will take that to heart. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/git-revert-a-better-way/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>New year, more like me</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/new-year-2024/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been years since I finished a side project on time. An idea takes shape. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;This should only take me a day or two,&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I think, optimistically. Then, life takes over. Between my kid, my job, and single-handedly running our household, the end of the day comes fast. My personal time comes after work is over and our bedtime routine is done. It is full of best intentions, until I fall asleep in a heap of exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I do get to these side projects, but even this new year&#39;s post is days late. This chronic problem has a host of reasons. The scattered feeling in my brain, because I have too many things to do and too little time to do it. The frustration that comes with feeling so scattered. The feelings of inadequacy. The imposter syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will never blame motherhood for this, because being a mom is something I wanted for a long time. It is something I worked hard for and I love my child and every minute&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/new-year-2024/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with motherhood came a partial loss of self. Being a mom is &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, and there are only so many hours in a day. The time I had before for side projects is now time I spend teaching, mom-ing, managing a household of 2, and -- of course -- playing.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/new-year-2024/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The loss comes out of missing the time I had for these side projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why are side projects important?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer, side projects allow me the space to do something unique and more aligned with my interests. They give me the chance to experiment and play in the geekiest way possible. This kind of experimentation is rarely possible in my &lt;em&gt;(or any)&lt;/em&gt; day job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost every developer I know has a side project (or three). The idea of a side project has become so ubiquitous, that questions like &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;What projects do you work on outside of work?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; are standard in development job interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My side projects allow me to explore other aspects of myself. They can help me answer the question of, &amp;quot;where do I see myself in 5 years?&amp;quot;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/new-year-2024/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; They help me figure how who I am as a professional, compentent, and creative adult. This is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is this &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no secret that, in many societies, women are stereotypically expected to take on more household responsibilities. The BBC article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210518-the-hidden-load-how-thinking-of-everything-holds-mums-back&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The hidden load: How &#39;thinking of everything&#39; holds mums back&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; discusses the toll this takes on women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article focuses on women in heterosexual relationships, but it touches on many points that I also feel as a single mother. The work it takes to be a mother is physically and mentially exhausting, because it never ends. A sub-heading in the article summarizes it perfectly as &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;invisible, unlimited work.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s no wonder I&#39;m exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It is time for a change.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I was inspired by the idea of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE&quot;&gt;yearly theme&lt;/a&gt; via a CGP Grey video.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/new-year-2024/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; To that end, I decided my theme for 2024 is &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Finding Myself&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this quest in the latter half of last year&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/new-year-2024/#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but I want to make it official in this new year. What this looks like in practice is still to be determined, but my hope is to focus on the things that make me feel more like me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traveling with my kid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Escaping my mostly-sweatpants wardrobe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking out of my writer&#39;s block&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making art with my kid&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/new-year-2024/#fn6&quot; id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New year, &lt;s&gt;new&lt;/s&gt; more like me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, most minutes. I do not enjoy tantrums. 0 stars. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/new-year-2024/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play is important and fun! 5 stars. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/new-year-2024/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually cannot stand this as an interview question. I understand that you want access to the plans I have in my head, but those plans also change based on circumstances and 5 years is a lot of time. 1 star. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2024/01/new-year-2024/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

I first learned about him from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hellointernet.fm/&quot;&gt;Hello Internet podcast&lt;/a&gt; (no longer active), and am now a fan of his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@CGPGrey&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@cortexFM&quot;&gt;Cortex podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Myke Hurley.

      <title>Patience</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/10/patience/</link>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;First, a story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:50 am&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red sedan pulls into the school driveway. &amp;quot;Bye kiddo,&amp;quot; it says. A child gets out of the car, ready to walk to the front doors. &amp;quot;Have a great day!&amp;quot; As the passenger door closes, the car moves forward, anxious to get the day started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It immediately stops, blocked by traffic. A double line of cars obstruct the only path through the lot, waiting. The red sedan inches forward, to the side, then forward again, until, frustrated, it concedes defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kiss and Ride line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:54 am&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red sedan is late. &amp;quot;My child is already standing at the door,&#39; it thinks. &amp;quot;I do not belong here.&amp;quot; It desperately looks for a way out. The parking spaces, littered with cars, offer no shortcuts. The red sedan, its tension rising as the minutes pass, is now trapped as more cars file in behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:00 am&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school doors open, exactly on time. The line begins to move. &amp;quot;Finally,&amp;quot; it thinks angrily. The red sedan races forward, only to stop short again. This parade of cars starts and stops, allowing children to get out as they approach the front. The line is fulfilling its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red sedan opens its window. It makes a plea to the car next to it, but nothing can be done. The line has its rules. The red sedan must follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:03 am&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, the red sedan sees the front of the line. With the freedom of the parking lot exit in sight, it punches the gas and, again, races forward -- into the red SUV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The red sedan, finally, stops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And now, an explanation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story above is a true story &lt;em&gt;(with some liberties taken to help the narration)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/10/patience/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Before I get into the details, no one was hurt. Teachers working the Kiss &amp;amp; Ride line called it a &amp;quot;small fender-bender&amp;quot;. I was neither the car in this story -- merely a witness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How Kiss &amp;amp; Ride works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiss &amp;amp; Ride at our school is straight-forward. There is a single parking lot next to the school, which is a one-way loop. Cars drive into the loop and form a double line. The loop through the lot is wide enough for the double line, but this definitely does not allow room for anyone to pass through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the school doors open, the cars at the front of the line let their kids out, then leave, making room for the cars behind it to drive up and drop off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This morning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I drove my daughter to school this morning, we were behind the red sedan as it pulled into the lot. We saw the drop off and the attempts to get ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One lane of the double line always moves faster than the other. I happened to be in the slower of the two, so at some point, the red sedan got ahead of us, which is how I was able to see the fender-bender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Back to patience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mornings are hard. They are hard for most people, but they are next-level hard for parents of school-aged children. If you know, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you plan your day perfectly. On other days, work is so ridiculous, you no longer recognize it. Or your child gets sick on the most exciting day of the week. Or, your heart gets broken by a passion project gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on those days, you fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling apart is hard. You don&#39;t think through decisions. You lose patience. You forget your goals. You forget to breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will never know really happened inside that red sedan. But, something &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; happen that made them lose control, even just for a second. And sometimes, when you do that, you hit a wall. Or, in this case, a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, please, do yourself a favor. Be patient. Remember yourself. And don&#39;t forget to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, cars don&#39;t talk. However, in all seriousness, I have no idea what the driver was actually thinking or saying, but that car had a lot going on with it. Its feelings were pretty obvious, in a &amp;quot;drivers just know&amp;quot; kind of way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/10/patience/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Where did that quiet kid go?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am not a naturally social person. I do enjoy seeing people in real life, but what restores me is staying home with a good book or a Star Trek marathon. I am the textbook definition of an introvert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also naturally shy. As a child, I rarely spoke in class, not because I did not know the answer, but because I did not want to speak in front of my classmates. I once had a teacher ask me to say anything -- as in literally the word &amp;quot;anything&amp;quot; -- just to prove to her that I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; speak.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/09/quiet-kid/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things did not improve in my teen years. As a high school senior, I had to give a 45-minute presentation on Kepler&#39;s Laws of Planetary Motion. I am fairly certain I said words. I am less certain they were coherant.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/09/quiet-kid/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of that senior year brought great relief when I learned that I ranked 3rd in my class.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/09/quiet-kid/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The top 2 ranking seniors were given the honor of speaking at graduation. I was blissfully spared from that nightmare(-to-me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today. I speak at conferences. I actively participate in panel discussions. I teach and have led 3-hour-long classes.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/09/quiet-kid/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; speaking in front of a crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish I had advice or a five-step program or &amp;quot;one weird trick&amp;quot; to share, but I do not. I started speaking in front of other people out of necessity. Teaching stemmed from the need to do something different after being laid off from a particularly toxic job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conference speaking stemmed from the desire to attend conferences. I was in a position where there was very little money for conference travel. I had to apply for funding and was advised that my application would have a better chance if I was selected as a speaker. So, naturally, I applied to speak at every conference I wanted to attend. And then I was accepted to speak at four conferences in one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overboard? Yes. Worth it? Also yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first speaking gigs were nerve wracking, but it quickly became easier. I teach and speak about topics that are interesting to me. I trust &lt;em&gt;(hope?)&lt;/em&gt; that those who hear me find my talks equally interesting. I have fun at every speaking gig and will continue to speak for as long as these events will have me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-school-me could never have imagined this, but today-me couldn&#39;t be prouder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I complied and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; said the word &amp;quot;anything&amp;quot; to her. In retrospect, I don&#39;t think that helped. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/09/quiet-kid/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My presentation also included visual aids in the form of styrofoam balls painted as the planets of our solar system. There is a non-zero chance that I juggled Jupiter and Saturn during this presentation. Also, thank you universe for allowing my high school years to be before the era of smart phones and TikTok. There&#39;s no need to relive that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/09/quiet-kid/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish I could truthfully say I did that on purpose. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/09/quiet-kid/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also lost my voice once -- mid-sentence -- while teaching one of those 3-hour classes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/09/quiet-kid/#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Inspiration waits for no one</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/08/inspiration-waits-for-no-one/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a minimalist at heart. I do not like clutter -- physical or digital. The only decor in my house are things that I love or remind me of where I&#39;ve been. I semi-regularly purge my closets to make space, so clothes I wear don&#39;t get lost among the ones that are collecting dust. Bins of my daughter&#39;s toys are everywhere, which bothers me to no end, but my house is her house too. I crave inbox zero. &lt;em&gt;(As of this moment, the 6 emails in my inbox are making me antsy.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The calmness of my space makes me feel calm. Except for &lt;strong&gt;right now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few months have been utter chaos. Health issues of aging parents. Plans for a long-distance move for one of those parents. My daughter&#39;s last day of preschool. The demolition and subsequent re-decoration of her room, making way for her first &amp;quot;big girl bed&amp;quot;. Her first sleepover, in which &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; slept. Her birthday. Her upcoming first day of public school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this, in addtiion to my full-time-grown-up-job-that-pays-the-bills, have left me zero time to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, put my brain into the perfect position to subconsciously consider my current, slow-going, passion project. I have been &lt;strong&gt;flooded&lt;/strong&gt; with ideas that I cannot ignore. &lt;em&gt;Check out this idea for chapter 5.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Here is a detailed plan for how to research this.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Oh! Don&#39;t forget to write about this too.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;I have this perfectly formed passage that you can use at the start of chapter 2!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brain is failing to grasp the fact that I have not had time to even write a &lt;em&gt;haiku&lt;/em&gt;, much less a full novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is clear: I either need to tell my brain to stop thinking entirely, or quit my job and spend the next 6 months writing.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/08/inspiration-waits-for-no-one/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a terrible idea. I do not need to do this because full-time-grown-up-job-that-pays-the-bills, well, pays the bills. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/08/inspiration-waits-for-no-one/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Be careful out there: A phishing story</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/05/be-careful-out-there/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am about to go into &amp;quot;mom mode&amp;quot; for this post, because I recently came across (and &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; fell for) the most clever phishing attempt I have seen to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently had to replace my roof. The details are a much longer, unrelated story. Here are the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It rained outside.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, it rained &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I filed a claim with my insurance company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A roofer replaced my roof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end... mostly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My claim is still open, due to some of the longer, unrelated details. As a result of that, my insurance adjuster called me late last week to give me a status update. During that conversation, he also said that he needed to send out an invoice for some tarping work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is directly related to the phishing attempt. However, it does serve as context to what happened today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The phish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I received an email from Ann&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/05/be-careful-out-there/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with the subject line &amp;quot;Find attachment from We Make Roofs LLC&amp;quot;. The email contents said that Ann shared a document with me, via Adobe, and included a link for me to access the file. This was not unusual for them. During the roof replacement process, I received a lot of documents this way -- contracts, receipts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given my conversation last week with the adjuster, my first thought was that We Make Roofs LLC was trying to bill me for the aforementioned tarping work. Annoyed &lt;em&gt;(especially since I thought my side of the financials was done)&lt;/em&gt;, I clicked the link to figure this out.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/05/be-careful-out-there/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red flag #1:&lt;/strong&gt; The link took me to a page that redirected me to another page. The second page immediately asked for a user name and password. I never created an account with We Make Roofs LLC and our previous shared files never required passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I replied to the email, which went to &lt;code&gt;ann@wemakeroofs.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/05/be-careful-out-there/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, to ask what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red flag #2:&lt;/strong&gt; A few minutes later, I got a second email from We Make Roofs LLC. This time it was from Patricia, with the subject line &amp;quot;Urgent_ImportantDocs 05-01-2023&amp;quot;. This email didn&#39;t go to me directly, but to &amp;quot;Undisclosed Recipients&amp;quot;. This email practically screamed &amp;quot;I&#39;m a phish!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that conversation from the insurance company was still in the back of my mind. I called We Make Roofs LLC, using the contact information I already had for them, to figure out what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The real deal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, Ann and Patricia are real people. Ann is a customer liaison whom I&#39;d spoke with before. Patricia is the head of the billing department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We Make Roofs LLC is a smaller, local company, and they answered my call right away. The emails were definitely not a legitimate communication attempt. The person I spoke with said that Ann&#39;s email had been compromised, but they did not think Patricia&#39;s had as well. They had questions when I told them about the emails I had received and promised to relay my experience to their IT department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether the timing of this phish was intentional or not &lt;em&gt;(given my recent communication with insurance)&lt;/em&gt;, it almost got me. &lt;em&gt;Almost.&lt;/em&gt; I&#39;m sure it worked on someone. I am both impressed and really angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never click on anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No really. &lt;em&gt;Never&lt;/em&gt; click on &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an email feels suspect at all, especially if it is from a company that you have worked with, just call them.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/05/be-careful-out-there/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay safe out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Names of both people and companies have been changed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/05/be-careful-out-there/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Never click on links in an email, but the context, timing, and my annoyed state made me think this was real. My deepest apologies to every security person I know. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/05/be-careful-out-there/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, I changed all the names. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is not a real email, but the email I replied to was a legit email for the real company. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/05/be-careful-out-there/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know, I hate making phone calls too, but sometimes it&#39;s good for you. Trust me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/05/be-careful-out-there/#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Git reversions by tag (and why git can be a scary place)</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/04/git-reversions-by-tag/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using git for &lt;em&gt;(checks watch)&lt;/em&gt; over a decade and reverting commits &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; trips me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently came across a bug in our code. This codebase is regularly deployed to production and we know production does not have this bug. This gave us a good idea of when the bug was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very long story short, the decided goal was to revert this repository back to the last known good commit. &lt;em&gt;(Seriously, it&#39;s a much longer story, irrelevant to this one.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, here is an example of (basically) what the git log looked like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;11111 (HEAD -&amp;gt; master) Latest commit
22222 Another commit
33333 Start of the bug
44444 Last known good commit
55555 Random good commit
66666 Another random good commit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to cleanly revert several commits, back to the &amp;quot;last known good commit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Bookmark the commits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to tag the relevant commits for this reversion. This includes the latest commit, the first buggy commit, and the last known good commit. Bookmarking these commits allows me to find them more easily later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git tag -a LatestCommit 11111
git push origin LatestCommit

git tag -a BuggyCommit 33333
git push origin BuggyCommit

git tag -a BeforeBuggy 44444
git push origin BeforeBuggy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can make sure my tags are in place by running &lt;code&gt;git log --pretty=oneline&lt;/code&gt;. My commits should now look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;11111 (HEAD -&amp;gt; master, tag: LatestCommit) Latest commit
22222 Another commit
33333 (tag: BuggyCommit) Start of the bug
44444 (tag: BeforeBuggy) Last known good commit
55555 Random good commit
66666 Another random good commit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Go back in time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part that is a bit odd. I am sure there is a better way to accomplish a clean reversion. However, this was the method that worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of this step is to revert &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; to point to the commit where the bug was introduced. I could checkout the tag insead of resetting, but that would put me into a detached head state, which is something I almost always want to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git reset --hard BuggyCommit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locally, this moves &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; to that &lt;code&gt;BuggyCommit&lt;/code&gt; and removes all commits that came before it. My git log now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;44444 (HEAD -&amp;gt; master, tag: BeforeBuggy) Last known good commit
55555 Random good commit
66666 Another random good commit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a bit scary, but a quick look at the remote branch in GitHub reassures me that the other commits still exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt; command also tells me that my local branch is behind its remote counterpart by all of the commits that came after this &lt;code&gt;BuggyCommit&lt;/code&gt;. This makes sense, given that these commits still exist remotely. I have not actually reverted any changes. In order to officially revert this branch to the last known good commit, we must revert the current buggy commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git revert BuggyCommit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will create a reversion commit for everything that was part of the commit tagged &lt;code&gt;BuggyCommit&lt;/code&gt;. In order to get this all into &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, we need to force a push of this reversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git push origin +main
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the git log looks like this, both locally and remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;12345 (HEAD -&amp;gt; master) Revert &amp;quot;Last known good commit&amp;quot;
44444 (tag: BeforeBuggy) Last known good commit
55555 Random good commit
66666 Another random good commit
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other commits after that last known good commit have vanished. Well, that&#39;s terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; terrifying?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes and no. The repository&#39;s log has permanently changed to remove those newer commits. However, believe it or not, we were smart earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember step 1 above, where we also created those &lt;code&gt;LatestCommit&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BuggyCommit&lt;/code&gt; tags? Those tags -- and the changes they contain -- &lt;em&gt;still exist&lt;/em&gt;. The magic of tags. I&#39;m still in shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Retrospective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this smart? No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this interesting? Omg, yes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, there are definitely some things that could have been done differently here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make a backup copy of the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch&lt;/strong&gt; before starting any of this. If anything, this fun experiment proved that git, in the wrong hands, will wipe away your data forever. At least if you are not careful. The tags I created saved that data. However, a better backup would have been to create a new branch of &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, before I started any part of this experiment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;git revert&lt;/code&gt; on all of the commits&lt;/strong&gt;. With the method above, I only created a revert commit of the first commit after the last known good state. The rest of the commits were never officially reverted. They simply vanished. It would been more thorough to use &lt;code&gt;git revert&lt;/code&gt; on all commits individually to create reversion commits for each one. That way, the log history would remain preserved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is a scary place. I recommend none of the processes in this post &lt;em&gt;(except for maybe the retrospective)&lt;/em&gt;, so use the knowledge here at your own risk. I wrote all of this up because I did something ridiculous and found it interesting. Don&#39;t be like me. Be like... the opposite of me. Or, at least the opposite of the me who wrote this post. Good luck and good day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Converting static blocks to dynamic blocks</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/03/static-to-dynamic-block-conversion/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started working with custom Gutenberg blocks sometime in late 2017. Or, perhaps, it was early 2018. To be honest, the timing is a bit fuzzy because I was pregnant at the time and pregnancy brain is real. For those of you keeping track, these timeframes are well before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/documentation/wordpress-version/version-5-0/&quot;&gt;WordPress 5 release date of December 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, it has been a while. Gutenberg was still in development and significantly changing with every new &lt;em&gt;(alpha)&lt;/em&gt; release. Meanwhile, our team at work was planning to migrate our 300+ sites from Drupal to WordPress. We knew that Gutenberg had to be part of that plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a lot of blocks in those early days.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/03/static-to-dynamic-block-conversion/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; of them were static blocks. I did not know dynamic blocks were a possibility until we needed to write our own custom &amp;quot;Latest News&amp;quot; block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an agile team, we tweaked those original blocks multiple times. This is what fueled my &lt;a href=&quot;https://talks.jhalabi.com/dynamic-blocks/#/&quot;&gt;dislike of static blocks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ask: Convert our static blocks to dynamic blocks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not the only person on my team with a dislike of static blocks. We were all tired of the hassles of the deprecation errors that inevitably occurred. Then one day we asked, how can we convert these static blocks to dynamic blocks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer was two-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new, dynamic version of the original static block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a content migration script to replace instances of the static block with its new dynamic version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy peasy. Right? Right. Let&#39;s do this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Rewrite the block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&#39;t convert a static block to a dynamic block, so the first step is to create that new dynamic block. This step is relatively straight-forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only two required changes: create an additional registration function in PHP and replace the JavaScript &lt;code&gt;save()&lt;/code&gt; function with a PHP &lt;code&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; function. The JavaScript side of the block registration, as well as the &lt;code&gt;edit()&lt;/code&gt; function can remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are undertaking a larger block refactor and need some help, I recommend reading through the WordPress how-to guide on &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/creating-dynamic-blocks/&quot;&gt;creating dynamic blocks&lt;/a&gt; or my own article about how I &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/09/writing-custom-wp-block&quot;&gt;write a custom WordPress block&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Migrate your content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This migration step is more complex, but very important, part of the process. There is no reason for both the static and dynamic versions of a block to exist. The end goal is for the dynamic block to completely replace the original static block. Therefore, all instances of the static block need to be transformed into the new dynamic version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;An example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution was to write a one-off script in PHP to handle the migration. For illustrative purposes, let&#39;s pretend that we want to replace the existing core Paragraph (static) block with a new dynamic Paragraph block.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/03/static-to-dynamic-block-conversion/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The static version of the block is saved with the HTML for the paragraph enclosed in Gutenberg block indicator comments. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And the seasons they go round and round&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the migration is to re-save this block in the post content, so that the markup is removed and all content is saved as meta data inside the block indicators. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- wp:my/new-paragraph 
{&amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;And the seasons they go round and round&amp;quot;} 
/--&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal was to auto-migrate all Paragraph content at once. I am going to present the entire script first, then explain it further below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;class MigrateParagraph {

  private const OLD_P_REGEX = 
    &#39;/&amp;lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(.*)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- &#92;/wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;/sU&#39;;

  /**
   * __construct()
   */
  public function __construct() {
    add_action( &#39;init&#39;, [ $this, &#39;migrate&#39; ] );
  }


  /**
   * migrate()
   * 
   * Migrate all posts on the site.
   * 
   * @return void
   */
  public function migrate(): void {
    // First, get all posts.
    $posts = $this-&amp;gt;get_all_posts();

    // Loop through the posts.
    foreach ( $posts as $post ) {
      // Get all instances of the old Paragraph block 
      // in this post.
      preg_match_all( 
        self::OLD_P_REGEX, 
        $post-&amp;gt;post_content, 
        $matches
      );

      // The matches are stored in an array with 2 items. 
      //   * [0]: All matched text (the entire block)
      //   * [1]: The saved content in the matched text. 
      //     This is the paragraph content
      // Check to see if one of the array items has a 
      // length. If not, there is nothing to migrate. 
      // Move on.
      if ( !$matches[1] ) { continue; }

      // Loop through all of the paragraphs by looping 
      // through the saved content (index 1).
      for ( $i=0; $i&amp;lt;count($matches[1]); $i++ ) {
        $new_paragraph = &#39;&amp;lt;!-- wp:my/new-paragraph 
          {&amp;quot;content&amp;quot;:&#39; . $matches[1][$i] . &#39;&amp;quot;} /--&amp;gt;&#39;;

        // Replace the old block (index [0] in the matches 
        // array) with the new block content.
        $post-&amp;gt;post_content = str_replace(
          $matches[0][$i], 
          $new_paragraph,
          $post-&amp;gt;post_content
        );
      }

      // Update the post with the migrated content.
      wp_update_post( $post );
    }
  }


  /**
   * get_all_posts()
   *
   * Get every post, so that we can look through them 
   * for migratable blocks.
   *
   * @return array
   */
  private function get_all_posts(): array {
    // Arguments to get all posts and pages, and 
    // reusable blocks.
    $args = [
      &#39;numberposts&#39; =&amp;gt; -1,
      &#39;post_status&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;any&#39;,
      &#39;post_type&#39;   =&amp;gt; [&#39;post&#39;, &#39;page&#39;, &#39;wp_block&#39;]
    ];

    // Return an array of post objects.
    return get_posts( $args );
  }

}

new MigrateParagraph;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, that was a lot. Details time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The regular expression&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the script defines the regular expression used to find all existing static Paragraph blocks in the post content:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;private const OLD_P_REGEX = 
  &#39;/&amp;lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;(.*)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;!-- &#92;/wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;/sU&#39;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This regular expression locates the block by its block indicator comments and isolates the paragraph content &lt;em&gt;(using the &lt;code&gt;(.*)&lt;/code&gt; capture)&lt;/em&gt;. That paragraph content is saved in the dynamic block&#39;s meta data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The loop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part of the script gets all posts across all relevant post types, so that we can loop through each post to look for the Paragraph block. In this example, we want to collect a list of all posts, pages, and &lt;code&gt;wp_blocks&lt;/code&gt;, which is the post type used for reusable blocks.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/03/static-to-dynamic-block-conversion/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script then loops through all posts and checks to see if the static Paragraph block exists in that post. If at least one Paragraph block is found, the migration continues. Otherwise, the script moves on to the next post in the loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The migration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the tricky part. Once the loop finds at least one static Paragraph block n the post, that match is saved to an array. This array contains two items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An array of all matched text items in the post. This is the the entire Paragraph block code, including block indicator comments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An array of all captured paragraph content in the matched text items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the example above, the array will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;[
  [0] =&amp;gt; [
    [0] =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;&amp;lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;And the seasons they go round and round&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&amp;gt;&amp;quot;,
    [1] =&amp;gt; ...
  ],
  [1] =&amp;gt; [
    [0] =&amp;gt; &amp;quot;And the seasons they go round and round&amp;quot;,
    [1] =&amp;gt; ...
  ]
]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two array items in the array mirror each other. So, the matched text in the first item in array index &lt;code&gt;[0]&lt;/code&gt; contains the captured paragraph content in the first item in array index &lt;code&gt;[1]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a list of all blocks to be migrated, we can convert them into the format used by the dynamic version of our new Paragraph block. We loop through each of these matches and perform the conversion in two steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we create the code for the new block, using the content in array index &lt;code&gt;[1]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;$new_paragraph = &#39;&amp;lt;!-- wp:my/new-paragraph 
  {&amp;quot;content&amp;quot;:&#39; . $matches[1][$i] . &#39;&amp;quot;} /--&amp;gt;&#39;;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we use the string replacement PHP function to replace the corresponding match text from array index &lt;code&gt;[0]&lt;/code&gt; with the code for the new block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;$post-&amp;gt;post_content = str_replace(
  $matches[0][$i], 
  $new_paragraph,
  $post-&amp;gt;post_content
);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The save&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we have finished the migration for a particular post, we use the &lt;code&gt;wp_update_post($post)&lt;/code&gt; function to save our changes to the database. This has the added benefit of creating a new revision for the post. This is great as a backup, just in case somethng goes wrong or we need to refer back to the post&#39;s pre-migration state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paragraph example above is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; basic overview of how I have been writing static-to-dynamic block migrations. A migration for a more complex example will naturally be more complex. I have written two of these migrations so far for two very different blocks. Each migration has been different, involving custom development for each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no concrete formula for a migration like this because we are 100% in edge-case territory. Ideally, you will need to do very, very few of these types of migrations, if any at all. My hope for this article is to give you an idea of what you are in for if you happen to need to perform a similar migration. YMMV. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to tell you a dirty secret. I did not know React when I was writing those early blocks. As a matter of fact, I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; don&#39;t know React. My &amp;quot;React&amp;quot; skillset is extremely limited to the Gutenberg API. So, now you know. React experience is not actually a requirement to work with custom blocks. You&#39;re welcome? &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/03/static-to-dynamic-block-conversion/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a terrible idea to do in reality. Please do not replace the core Paragraph block on your own site. Not only is it an extremely useful and solid block, it is also the default block used by the WordPress. If a content editor just starts typing in the post editor, that content automatically goes into a Paragraph block. Removing and replacing this block will really mess up the editor. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/03/static-to-dynamic-block-conversion/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not forget about reusable blocks! Reusable blocks are saved as references in the post content of a page or post. Their content is not directly saved to a page or post. (If a reusable block is updated, that update is applied to all pages and posts on which it appears. This is &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; why a reusable block is saved by reference.) Therefore, we &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; need to include reusable blocks as a post type for these types of content migrations. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2023/03/static-to-dynamic-block-conversion/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Writing a custom WordPress block</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/09/writing-custom-wp-block/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post has been a long time coming. I have talked about custom WordPress block creation for several years now, from blogging about &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/09/writing-custom-wp-block/blog/2021/10/wordpress-block-json&quot;&gt;registering dynamic blocks with &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to speaking at various conferences about why &lt;a href=&quot;https://talks.jhalabi.com/dynamic-blocks/&quot;&gt;dynamic blocks are awesome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It recently occurred to me that I have yet to write up a complete post about how I write my custom blocks. Every so often, someone asks me about the code I write, so here is a comprehensive overview of how I write a custom block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General philosophy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hot take: I am a big advocate of dynamic blocks. As an overview, a &lt;strong&gt;dynamic block&lt;/strong&gt; is a block whose front-end markup is generated via the WordPress PHP backend, as the page is called. In contrast, a &lt;strong&gt;static block&lt;/strong&gt; is a block whose markup is saved directly to the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are definite advantages and disadvantages to both. TL;DR: I am a big fan of the dynamic approach because I often receive requests to edit blocks after they are used on live sites. Editing a static block requires writing a deprecation for the block&#39;s previous version. My personal goal is to include as few deprecations as possible in my blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to illustrate how I write a custom Gutenberg block. I want to keep this tutorial as simple as possible. Therefore, the example block here will be one that displays a word and its definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The anatomy of a custom block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A custom dynamic block is written using a combination of JavaScript (JS) and PHP. The JavaScript side handles the post editor experience, while the PHP side handles the front-end experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, the block needs 4 pieces (files). I place all of these files in the same directory in order to simplify the code &lt;em&gt;(since these files need to find and talk to each other)&lt;/em&gt;. It also really helps with code organization when I am registering multiple blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;BLOCK_DIRECTORY&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt;: defines the block structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;edit.js&lt;/code&gt;: a JS module that defines the block&#39;s edit functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;register.php&lt;/code&gt;: registers the block on the PHP side and defines how the front-end is rendered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;: registers the block on the JS side&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s dive deeper into each of these files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt;: Defining the block&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; file defines how the block is structured, what attribute it uses, and what metadata is applicable to the block. This metadata includes information like the block&#39;s name, description, keywords, and icon. It is used by both the PHP and JavaScript registration functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, I want to define the following pieces of information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The unique machine name of my block, which the post editor will use to identify the block any time it is used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The human-readable name of my block.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;category&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The category that my block will be listed under in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/article/blocks/&quot;&gt;Block Inserter&lt;/a&gt;. For this example, I will use the &amp;quot;Text&amp;quot; out-of-the-box category. You can also &lt;a href=&quot;https://gutenberghub.com/how-to-create-custom-block-category/&quot;&gt;create your own custom category&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;description&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The human-readable description of my block. It is best to keep this short, maybe tweet length.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;attributes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: The pieces of content that my block needs to save. In this case, I need to save 2 strings, the dictionary word and the definition. The &lt;code&gt;attributes&lt;/code&gt; item is an object and each piece of content inside is its own object that defines the content&#39;s variable type &lt;em&gt;(e.g. string, integer, boolean)&lt;/em&gt; and an optional default value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; includes more metadata options than are applicable to this example. You can refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/&quot;&gt;WordPress&#39;s block API metadata reference guide&lt;/a&gt; for a complete list of all available options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what my example block&#39;s JSON file look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;$schema&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/block.json&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;apiVersion&amp;quot;: 2,

  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;my/word&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Dictionary Word&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;category&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;text&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Present a word and its definition&amp;quot;,

  &amp;quot;attributes&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;string&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    },
    &amp;quot;definition&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;string&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;edit.js&lt;/code&gt;: Defining the editor UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gutenberg editor is written in ReactJS. Therefore, any customizations to that editor need to also be written in JavaScript. This &lt;code&gt;edit.js&lt;/code&gt; file defines a JS module that will create the editor UI for this custom block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This module defines a function that will be called in the JS registration for this block. &lt;em&gt;(We will get to the JS registration later on in this article.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function accepts a single &lt;code&gt;props&lt;/code&gt; parameter, which is an object that is automatically passed to the block edit function by Gutenberg. This object contains all of the information about the block, including, but not limited to, its attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;edit()&lt;/code&gt; function then uses Gutenberg components to construct an editor interface that can be used to add and edit the block&#39;s content. In this case, we will use the Gutenberg &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/components/src/text-control&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;TextControl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; component to construct the input field for both the word and the definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The module code, commented with further explanations, is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// The JS module is a function, saved to a constant variable.
const WordEdit = ( props ) =&amp;gt; {

  // The `useBlockProps()` function from the block editor library
  // allows the block to include default classes and components, 
  // like the block selection toolbar, in the editor UI. The 
  // block will be unselectable without this.
  const { useBlockProps } = wp.blockEditor;

  // We run the `useBlockProps()` function to save these classes
  // and properties as a string, which will will add to the 
  // editor UI markup below.
  const blockProps = useBlockProps();

  // The `TextControl` component provides us with an input box
  // that a user can use to add and edit the word and definition
  // in our block.
  const { TextControl } = wp.components;

  // `setAttributes` is a function passed by the block properties
  // which will allow us to save any changes to the block 
  // attributes.
  const { setAttributes } = props;

  // Extract our block&#39;s attributes (`word` and `definition`) 
  // from the `attributes` object inside the block properties.
  const { word, definition } = props.attributes;
  
  // Here, we create change event handlers that will run whenever
  // one of the attributes is edited. The handlers are functions
  // that call the `setAttributes` function (from our block

  const onChangeWord = ( value ) =&amp;gt; { 
    setAttributes( { word: value } )
  };
  
  const onChangeDefinition = ( value ) =&amp;gt; { 
    setAttributes( { definition: value } )
  };

  // This edit function is required to return the edit UI 
  // markup. The markup here is written in JSX.
  return (
    { /* JSX requires that a single element be returned, so */ }
    { /* we enclose everything in a `div`. The `blockProps` */ }
    { /* provides the classes and attributes necessary to */ }
    { /* render the block properly in the post editor. */ }

};

export default WordEdit;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;register.php&lt;/code&gt;: Defining the front-end UI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;register.php&lt;/code&gt; file is only required because we are creating this block as a dynamic block. This file has 2 jobs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Register the block on the PHP side so that we can dynamically construct the block&#39;s front-end markup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a &lt;code&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; function to construct the block&#39;s front-end markup. This is done as a callback from the registration function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer to create a class for each block. This is not strictly necessary, but I find it makes the code much more readable, especially in cases where I am registering a lot of blocks. &lt;em&gt;(For example, at work, we have a plugin that registers over 40 blocks.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PHP code, commented with further explanations, is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php

// Namespace for my block class.
namespace My&#92;Blocks;

class Word {

  /**
   * __construct()
   * 
   * This function calls the block&#39;s PHP registration function
   * (below) using the WordPress `init` action.
   */
  public function __construct() {
    add_action( &#39;init&#39;, [ $this, &#39;register&#39; ] );
  }


  /**
   * register()
   * 
   * This is the function that is called by the above `init`
   * action. It contains a single call to the WordPress
   * `register_block_type()` function, which will register the
   * block. 
   * 
   * The first parameter, `__DIR__` specifies the
   * location of the `block.json` file, which is in the same 
   * directory as the PHP file for this example.
   * 
   * The second parameter is an arguments array. In this case,
   * we are only including a single argument that defines the
   * render callback. The render callback is a function that 
   * defines the block&#39;s front-end markup. 
   *
   * @return void
   */
  public function register(): void {
    register_block_type( __DIR__, [
      &#39;render_callback&#39; =&amp;gt; [ $this, &#39;render&#39; ]
    ] );
  }


  /**
   * render()
   *
   * This is the function that is called by the `render`
   * callback in the `register()` function above. It
   * takes the block attributes and uses that content to
   * create the block&#39;s front-end display.
   * 
   * @param array $attributes Block attributes
   * 
   * @return string
   */
  public function render( $attributes ): string {
    // Extract whatever block attribute data we need.
    $word = $attributes[&#39;word&#39;] ?? &#39;&#39;;
    $definition = $attributes[&#39;definition&#39;] ?? &#39;&#39;;

    // Create and return the front-end markup. I find it easier
    // to use a heredoc for readability purposes.
    return &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;HTML
      &amp;lt;dl&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;dt&amp;gt;$word&amp;lt;/dt&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;dd&amp;gt;$definition&amp;lt;/dd&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/dl&amp;gt;
HTML;
  }

}

// Instantiate the class.
new Word;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt;: Registering the block&#39;s JS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;index.js&lt;/code&gt; file simply registers the block in the JavaScript. Its registration function requires 3 pieces of information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The location of the &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; file, which defines the block&#39;s name, attributes, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;code&gt;edit()&lt;/code&gt; function, which defines the block&#39;s editor UI. We already wrote this function above in the &lt;code&gt;edit.js&lt;/code&gt; file, so all we need to do here is point this edit function to our block edit module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;code&gt;save()&lt;/code&gt; function, which defines the block&#39;s front-end UI. For a static block, this function would return a string with the block&#39;s markup. However, since we are defining a dynamic block, this function is not needed. We tell it to return null, to indicate to the post editor that the markup will be generated by the PHP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the &lt;code&gt;edit.js&lt;/code&gt; file above, I prefer to write this JavaScript registration file as a module, which can be imported elsewhere inside of a larger plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This JavaScript code, commented with further explanations, is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Import the `WordEdit` module, defined above in `edit.js`
// as simply `Edit` to make reading the code easier.
import { default as Edit } from &#39;./edit.js&#39;;

// We also import `block.json` as a module, for use in the
// registration function below. 
import { default as Metadata } from &#39;./block.json&#39;;

const WordEdit = ( () =&amp;gt; {

  // Block registration uses the `registerBlockType` function
  // from the `wp-blocks` package. I like to extract that here
  // for reading ease.
  const { registerBlockType } = wp.blocks;

  // Call the registration function.
  // The first parameter is the `Metadata` import from above,
  // which is the `block.json` file.
  // The second parameter is an arguments object, which contains
  // the `edit()` and `save()` functions.
  registerBlockType( Metadata, {
    // The `edit()` function passes the block properties
    // (`props`) and returns the `Edit` import from above.
    edit: ( props ) =&amp;gt; {
      return ( Edit( props ) );
    },

    // As stated above, the `save()` function simply returns
    // `null`, because this is a dynamic block.
    save: () =&amp;gt; {
      return null;
    }
  });

} )();

export default WordEdit;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is a super-basic overview of how I, a single developer, create custom WordPress blocks. As with most things in programming, there are 86 different &lt;em&gt;(and valid)&lt;/em&gt; approaches to a code solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can learn a ton from the WordPress block API documentation. Many of the modules and components are documented and all core WordPress code is publicly available. &lt;em&gt;(Hooray for open source!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Was my degree a mistake?</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/degree-a-mistake/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the latest news about exponentially-rising tuition costs and student debt forgiveness, I keep asking myself whether college was truly necessary. Truth be told, I have been asking that quite a bit over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to college in the late 1990s, starting off as a dual major in computer science and physics. I wanted to work for NASA. I knew I would never cut it as an astronaut, though I had been dreaming about it since I was 8 years old. So, college-freshman me decided working as a scientist was the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a year into the program, I made a life-changing discovery. I cannot stand calculus. As in, I would have rather watched a video upload via a 28k modem&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/degree-a-mistake/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; than solved a differential equation. This was a bit of a problem, being a physics major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not a huge fan of the computer science program either. At that point, I had discovered the internet and immediately fell in love. I taught myself HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript outside of my classes. Creating a website was far more rewarding than writing C++ and STL code that took forever to compile and often crashed my computer. These computer science course programs seemed to neither work nor bring me joy.
I switched my major, keeping computer science, but adding on electronic media as a second major. I thought the combination of the two could come close to a &amp;quot;web design and development&amp;quot; degree. I know this degree exists now, but there was no such thing back in the 90s, so this was close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fast forward to today.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, more than 20 years later, there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; web development university programs. There are also bootcamps, certificate courses, and self-driven tutorials. All of these options are as good, if not better, than a university program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I said it.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/degree-a-mistake/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; A web development bootcamp, for example, is as good or better than going to college. These programs have several advantages over a traditional university degree:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These programs are designed so that it is possible to learn development skills in a very short amount of time, often months rather than years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of their rapidity, they are frequently updated to keep pace with a developer&#39;s world of constantly changing languages, libraries, and standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bootcamps, especially, have a singular goal of giving students exactly the skills they need to get an entry-level job. Many also include career support services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These programs are generally &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; cheaper than a typical 4-year degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, universities have their own distinct advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The slower pace of a 4-year degree means that students can dive deeper into subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a part of university life opens students up to new people and experiences&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/degree-a-mistake/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the end, a student has a college degree, which, maddeningly, is still a requirement for many employers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But, is it worth it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have noticed that more and more job postings are less focused on a degree requirement and more focused on demonstrable skills. Can you prove you know language X or library Y? That is a much more reachable bar for people to grab. Instead of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend a bunch of money&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/degree-a-mistake/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and/or take out a bunch of loans to go to university.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn a bunch of skills, many of which from your freshman year will be out of date by your senior year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earn a degree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a job by showing off everything you learned in university.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend many years or even decades paying off the aforementioned loans&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/degree-a-mistake/#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, while still...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually learn new skills outside of college to keep up with your ever-changing industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, a person can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend far less money to go to a bootcamp or no money to learn via self-taught tutorials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn a bunch of skills at your own pace. You can spend as much or as little time on a skill but, this is usually far less than 4 years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop a portfolio that shows off your skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a job by showing off your portfolio and bragging that you can take the initiative to learn new skills, because you already did that to get this far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continually learn more new skills to keep up with your ever-changing industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it very promising that many more employers now realize the latter path is just as valid a career path as a college degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, did &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; make a mistake getting a degree?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is, no. I don&#39;t think so at least. A degree is 100% not a requirement to get a web development job now, but the career landscape was much, much different 25 years ago. A college degree was my only choice at the time. There were no bootcamps. There was not much in the way of self-driven tutorials. Being &amp;quot;self-taught&amp;quot; at that time involved going to a website and hitting &amp;quot;view source&amp;quot; in the browser. Tutorials are much fancier &lt;em&gt;(and useful!)&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is getting a degree right for you, future web developer? Well, I don&#39;t know you, so I can&#39;t answer that. You need to decide that for yourself. However, I will say that getting a degree is, by far, not your only option. You can get a good web development job, with or without a degree. As long as you learn the skills and can prove you can code, you&#39;ll do just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask your parents. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/degree-a-mistake/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said it &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I work in higher ed. Not sorry. You can stop clutching your pearls now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/degree-a-mistake/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really do believe that college life changes a person. For many, it is a completely new environment filled with new people from anywhere and everywhere. That is worth something. Is it worth tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars, though? &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/degree-a-mistake/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An amount of money that most people don&#39;t have. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/degree-a-mistake/#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This probably leaves you with not a ton of money left. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/degree-a-mistake/#fnref5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Published</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/published/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a published author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. Publishing a children&#39;s book was a shock, probably to everyone, but especially to me. I never thought that &amp;quot;author&amp;quot; would ever be a word that I could use to describe myself. Yet, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose this should not be &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; surprising. I spent my high school years writing (pretty terrible) poetry, some of which was published in our school&#39;s creative writing magazine. I started blogging when  I first got access to the internet. I&#39;m not even sure we called it blogging at the time. I updated my hand-coded and likely horribly inaccessible website with &amp;quot;updates&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was back in 1996, which was a bit late for many folks my age. The internet was not a household thought when I was growing up and my parents were rarely early adopters of technology. I first got online when I was in college, where freshman orientation included a crash course on the internet, email, and how to use the command line. &lt;em&gt;(The vast majority of our university systems were some flavor of UNIX workstation.)&lt;/em&gt; I taught myself the basics of HTML &lt;em&gt;(and later CSS, after it came to be)&lt;/em&gt;, and soon my website was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My writing history&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like I said, I have been writing for a while. Most of the things I have written remain unread &lt;em&gt;(probably)&lt;/em&gt;. Some have gained a bit of popularity, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/pregnancy/&quot;&gt;chronical of my pregnancy&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/03/carousels-no-one-likes-you&quot;&gt;rant on why you should never, ever, ever put a carousel on your website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I speak at conferences too. I 100% count this as a form of writing, since it involves much of the same process. Think of a topic. Outline the shape of topic&#39;s story. Write in the details. Speaking simply adds another step: Say the words out loud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, I have discovered that most of my writing that has been more popular&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/published/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; was born out of some amount of frustration or otherwise had an emotional drive. My pregnancy story was quite the complicated ride.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/published/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Website carousels are the bane of my professional existence. Most of my conference talks are almost always born out of whatever new hottness I am working on in any given year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;And now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/book/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is no different. This book was born out of both love and frustration. I love my daughter and we love reading together. We have a ton of books. There are books in every room of our house.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/published/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among our collection are &amp;quot;welcome baby&amp;quot; books. They are cute and I love them. In fact, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/26457275-welcome-little-one&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome Little One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the first book I ever read to my daughter and is still one of our favorites. However, just about all of these &amp;quot;welcome&amp;quot; books use plural pronouns. We. Us. Our. The messages are beautiful, but slightly awkward for a single-parent family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our collection also includes children&#39;s books about single-moms-by-choice (SMC) and donor conception. I brought and read these to introduce my daughter to the concept of how she came to be and why. Books like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52567923-mommy-and-me---how-i-came-to-be&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mommy and Me: How I Came To Be&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38671815-for-mommy-so-loved-you&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;For Mommy So Loved You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are also in regular reading rotation in our house. These books are fantastic now that my daughter 4, but, me being me, I wanted to introduce her to these concepts as early as possible. In fact, I told her about her &amp;quot;bio-dad&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;(the donor I used to conceive)&lt;/em&gt; when she was just a few days old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right, I know. Way too young for her to understand any of this. However, my philosophy has always been that I don&#39;t want her to remember when I first told her about her bio-dad. I don&#39;t want there to be a big reveal moment in her life. My goal is to make our &amp;quot;mommy and me&amp;quot; family as natural to her as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end, I was craving a &amp;quot;welcome baby&amp;quot; book that is inclusive of single-parent families &lt;em&gt;(e.g. no plural pronouns!)&lt;/em&gt; and at the level of a newborn, who is not going to fully grasp the concept of a SMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/book/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was born. It is a book where a mother welcomes her donor-conceived baby into the world. She promises to love them. She acknowledges their origin story without getting into the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/book/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the book I wanted to exist when my daughter was born and I am so excited to share it with anyone else who may be craving the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, shameless plug here. Please spread the word. And, if you have read the book and are so inclined, please leave an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Little-You-Joni-Halabi/dp/057839216X&quot;&gt;Amazon review&lt;/a&gt;. Even if you are not a fan of Amazon&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/published/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, it helps with rankings and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is, more than 1 person has read it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/published/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, in no small part, to hormones, but going it solo definitely helped to feed the fire. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/published/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except the bathrooms. I don&#39;t want to yuck anyone&#39;s yum, but bathroom books are not for us. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/published/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fun fact that I just learned, you do not need to buy a book on Amazon to review it. You can support your local bookstore or borrow a book from a library and still leave a review on Amazon. For better or worse, Amazon is great for exposure, especially for those of us who self-publish, and ratings help with Amazon rankings and recommendations. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/08/published/#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Work/life balance?</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/07/work-life-balance/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Joni is a full time developer. Joni is a single mom with a 4 year old. Joni is a newly &lt;em&gt;(almost)&lt;/em&gt; published author. &lt;em&gt;(T-3 days until launch!)&lt;/em&gt; Joni is a self-published author, which means Joni is also a PR agent. How does she do it all? We don&#39;t know. She’s not sure either. Seriously, it’s amazing everyone is still in one piece and the house didn’t burn down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting a little serious now.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, when did I get so busy? Back in my younger years, I would go to work, come home, and call it a day. These days? Not so much. I still go to work, but I no longer commute. &lt;em&gt;(Thanks pandemic?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/07/work-life-balance/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Theoretically, I should have more free time now, but I have a 4 year old, so in reality, I have less free time. In fact, I am in free-time debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When in Rome...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the natural solution to having no free time is to write and publish a book. Because, when you have &lt;em&gt;(time)&lt;/em&gt; debt, why not get some more?&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/07/work-life-balance/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/book/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is 100% a passion project. In fact, before writing the book, I was actually considering going to grad school to study machine learning.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/07/work-life-balance/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, the idea for this book came to me with such a force, I couldn&#39;t stop myself from writing it. After that, I had this baby of a book that I just &lt;em&gt;needed&lt;/em&gt; to edit and proofread and get reviewed. I found myself looking up illustrators and typing &amp;quot;how to self-publish a children&#39;s book&amp;quot; into my browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Long story short.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly one year later, here we are. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/book/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be officially born&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/07/work-life-balance/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on August 1, just 3 short days from when I am writing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, when I am not working my regular job and when I&#39;m not being a mom, &lt;em&gt;(though, let&#39;s get real, when I am I ever not being a mom??)&lt;/em&gt;, I am the exclusive PR representative for... me. It&#39;s not a terrible arrangement so far. PR-rep-me has already lined up book reviews, interviews, and even a little bit of buzz on Instagram. If release day goes well, I may even double her salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, actual-me doesn&#39;t have time to sleep much, which is how I find myself writing rambling articles about my lack of work/life balance at 12:58am. It&#39;s OK. Sleep is for the weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m kidding. Sleep is good for you. Go get your 8 hours of sleep and, while you&#39;re at it, eat well, exercise, and watch plenty of sci fi. Your balanced-you will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not to be glib, because the pandemic, especially the early parts, were &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt;. I could get into that more, but I won&#39;t. At least not here. Maybe in another blog post. But the pandemic is directly related to my now-permanent work-from-home status, and that is a change that I never, ever want to revert. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/07/work-life-balance/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is terrible advice, financial or otherwise. Do not, under any circumstances, listen to me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/07/work-life-balance/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;True story. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/07/work-life-balance/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Books are &amp;quot;born&amp;quot; on their official release date. Seems fitting here, since this is a book for babies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/07/work-life-balance/#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>To e-mail or not to e-mail</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/07/to-email-or-not-to-email/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have spent the last several weeks &lt;em&gt;(slowly)&lt;/em&gt; evaluating different email newsletter solutions because, according to my marketing plan, a newsletter is something I should consider starting. I mean, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a great way to get the news out about my book and any future writing I may (probably) do. However, I am not 100% convinced I have anything meaningful to say on a pseudo-regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the fact that I have no idea what the content of this theoretical newsletter will be &lt;em&gt;(kid lit? rants about web development? cookie recipes?)&lt;/em&gt;, there are &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of email newsletter services out there. How does anyone go about choosing one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a quick rundown of the options I looked at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://revue.co&quot;&gt;Revue (by Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the fact that this integrates with Twitter. I&#39;m on Twitter a lot anyway, so this seems like the obvious choice. It has a comprehensive newsletter template editor, though the UI makes it both hard to find and a bit unintuitive to use. The integration with my tweets really sold this solution for me. That is, until the 24+ hour outage that the system is having as I write this &lt;em&gt;(July 8-9, 2022)&lt;/em&gt;. Even when &lt;em&gt;(if?)&lt;/em&gt; this solution comes back, I am hesitant to use it because of the length, severity &lt;em&gt;(everything is down)&lt;/em&gt;, and lack of communication of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchimp.com/&quot;&gt;MailChimp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really solid choice with a free tier and an easy to use email newsletter template editor. Really, it has all of the features I need and want for a first-timer. My only issue is with the physical address required by the CAN-SPAM Act, which, to be honest, is an issue I will have with most any service. I am all for people reaching me at a physical address. I just don&#39;t want it to be my home address and I no longer have a physical location at the university, now that my job is remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://myemma.com/&quot;&gt;Emma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very pretty newsletters, but no free tier. In fact, the lowest tier is $99/month. I have no idea what I&#39;m doing and no subscribers. Sorry, but no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mailerlite.com/&quot;&gt;MailerLite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to be honest. I only looked at the website for this one. It looks like a simpler verison of MailChimp &lt;em&gt;(hence the name, right?)&lt;/em&gt;. Honestly, it probably would be a serious contender, but I was getting pretty fatigued with &amp;quot;too many choices&amp;quot; and was also evaluating ButtonDown when I learned about this one. &lt;em&gt;(More on that next.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://buttondown.email/&quot;&gt;ButtonDown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really unsure about this one at first, but I really like it. It&#39;s like a newsletter service for developers. Everything is in Markdown. It looks like I can control the look, specifically the email header and footer, with code. Code! All of the customization is code! It&#39;s like this solution knows me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The free tier only allows for 100 subscribers, but the next tier up is pretty cost-effective. The bonus is that they offer a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notion.so/b657ff246c884b6e82327449a114ea4e?v=1d857c36b82f452ea28afdf7844eea49&amp;amp;p=164a40bedd444dcfb6990cfefbe11dcd&quot;&gt;physical mailing address that will electronically forward mail&lt;/a&gt;, which allows me to comply with CAN-SPAM and retain my privacy. &lt;em&gt;(Seriously, I&#39;m cool with people sending me letters. I just don&#39;t want randos showing up at my door.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably obvious, but I&#39;m opting to go with ButtonDown for now. I definitely enjoyed nerding out while creating my newsletter template. Let&#39;s see if I&#39;ll get to actually use it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On book marketing</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/06/on-book-marketing/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;They say, &amp;quot;try to do something that scares you.&amp;quot; They say, &amp;quot;say yes to everything.&amp;quot; Who are &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;they&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;? And why exactly am I listening to them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing a book was scary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I take that back. Writing a book, specifically &lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt; wasn&#39;t scary. It was necessary. I started writing it, as I start writing most things, out of frustration. I love my daughter&#39;s little library of books. Ok, it&#39;s not so little. She has a 3-shelf bookcase in her room. And books on a shelf in her closet. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; 2 small shelves of books in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t even buy most of them. It&#39;s true that I can&#39;t help myself in a bookstore (in person or otherwise), but the majority of her books were gifts. At my baby shower, I received a number of &amp;quot;welcome baby&amp;quot; books, which we &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; to read, but they are full of &amp;quot;mommy and daddy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;, refering to the &amp;quot;typical&amp;quot; 2-parent family structure. My daughter and I have also read the collection of books out there that address other family structure: 2 moms, 2 dads, grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. Very few talk about single parents, or if they do, it is a passing reference or in the context of divorce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s not quite us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have the books that talk about donor conceived children that are specifically for families with single mothers by choice, like me. Those books are great! I started reading them to my daughter when she was 2, and then I quickly realized that those books were &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; going over her head. And that is fine. She will grow into them. But I was still craving a book that she could understand at a younger age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Marketing a book is scarier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a life-long programmer. I wrote my first line of code when I was 7. After some fits and starts, I made programming my career. It&#39;s logical. Computers make sense (for the most part). You tell a computer what to do and it (usually) does it.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/06/on-book-marketing/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are not computers. I am trying to sell my book. To people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketing (e.g. selling things to people) has never been my strong suit. There are no guarantees. There&#39;s no one right way to do it. There&#39;s no one way to do it period. You have to keep track of social media and a website and retail sites and reach out to indie bookstores and libraries and bloggers and Instagrammers and TikTok-ers &lt;em&gt;(and, btw, I&#39;m not even on TikTok)&lt;/em&gt; and maybe start a newsletter and, assuming people sign up for a newsletter, think of interesting things to say on a semi-regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a bit overwhelming, with a steep learning curve and a very large side of impostor syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scary for someone who&#39;s spent 20 years bossing computers around. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. Please &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/book/&quot;&gt;buy my book&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computers are weird. They really will do exactly what you tell them to. Even if &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; doesn&#39;t match your intent. And then there&#39;s AI. Don&#39;t get me started on AI. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/06/on-book-marketing/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Sweet Little You: Available for pre-order!</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/05/sweet-little-you-preorder/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is my birthday. This is not a marketing ploy. Today is actually my birthday. Being at the end of May, it often overlaps with the Memorial Day holiday weekend, which, to be honest is pretty nice. I get some time off to relax and recharge and catch up on my mile-long to-do list. It is a bonus that my child goes to a Montessori school that is inexplicably, but thankfully, open on almost every holiday, so I get some extra quiet time at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promise I did celebrate my birthday. I went out for lunch with friends two days in a row. I got a pedicure. &lt;em&gt;(My first since, I think, my birthday last year.)&lt;/em&gt; And now, I am catching up on the overwhelmingly large to-do list, most of which includes book marketing tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just updated my website -- this website -- with more information about &lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt;. I recently discovered that my book is available for pre-orders, at least on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Sweet-Little-You-Joni-Halabi/dp/057839216X/&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/sweet-little-you-joni-halabi/1141494961&quot;&gt;Barnes &amp;amp; Noble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Self-publishing is an adventure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still trying to figure out the ins and outs of self-publishing through IngramSpark. I enabled the book for distribution a couple of weeks ago, but it takes time to propagate to all of the major retailers. And &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;, it is up to those individual retailers to figure out what to do with the book. Will they list it on their site right away? Will they allow pre-order sales or wait until the official release date? Who knows?! I&#39;m not kidding. There is apparently no way to predict these things, other than to rely on previous trends from other books published via IngramSpark. As a programmer, the lack of a solid schedule bothers me. Publishing is indeed an entirely new world for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I seem to be burying the lead here. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt; -- a book that I wrote!! -- will be released on &lt;strong&gt;August 1&lt;/strong&gt;! And it is available for pre-orders. People &lt;em&gt;(you?)&lt;/em&gt; can buy it!! Right now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble seem to have jumped on this. I&#39;m still working on getting my book into indie bookstores, so if that is more up your alley, please stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wait... is this really happening?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never in my life did I think I would publish a book, much less a children&#39;s book. Yes, it&#39;s out there and I&#39;m &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, please, please do me a huge favor.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Something happened this weekend. Something big. I got the final illustrations for &lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt;! &lt;strong&gt;OMG OMG OMG!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lisawee12.com/&quot;&gt;Lisa Wee&lt;/a&gt;, a wonderfully talented illustrator, for the last few months and I couldn&#39;t be happier with the final version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am self-publishing and still working on an official release date, but expect this book to be available &lt;strong&gt;summer 2022&lt;/strong&gt;. For now, I am very excited to reveal the cover of &lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Carousels: No one likes you</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/03/carousels-no-one-likes-you/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh carousels. The last time I wrote about carousels, it was 2017 &lt;em&gt;(seemingly a lifetime ago)&lt;/em&gt;, when I shared a solution for fixing &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/04/keyboard-navigation-with-carousels&quot;&gt;keyboard navigation in carousels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know carousels have not magically disappeared in the last 5 years, but they have come up yet again in (work) conversation. To make a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; long story short, we know we have clients who want carousels on their sites. They tend to be our bigger sites, so we made a decision: Carousels on our main sites only. And you only get one. On the home page. That&#39;s it. All you smaller sites: no carousels for you. You don&#39;t need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, guess who wants carousels? You guessed it. &lt;em&gt;Everyone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[insert exasperated sigh here]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for all of you clients who want a carousel on your site, this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;No one wants to see your f-ing carousel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m serious. The only person who wants a carousel on your site is you. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s a self-serving vanity project so that you can showcase all of your babies at the same time without telling the world which one is your favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like a succinct source telling you why carousels are awful, there is an entire website dedicated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://shouldiuseacarousel.com/&quot;&gt;why you shouldn&#39;t use carousels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been numerous studies of the efficacy of carousels over the years. All of them concluded that carousels are terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Carousels look like ads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://beantin.se/sliding-banner-content-slider-carousel-rotator/&quot;&gt;That Big Sliding Banner? Yeah, It&#39;s Rubbish&lt;/a&gt;, by James Royal-Lawson, carousels are distracting and confusing to the user. They look like ads, or at the very least, not relevant content, so they are ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want your carousel babies to look like annoying banner ads? I&#39;m guessing no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;No one interacts with carousels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the study, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cheapwebdesign.co.uk/blog/how-effective-are-interactive-carousels-on-websites-in-2018-the-stats/&quot;&gt;How effective are interactive carousels on websites in 2018 – The Stats&lt;/a&gt;, via Cheap Web Design, almost no one is clicking on the links inside carousels. This particular study showed that only 1% of users clicked on the feature and, of those users, an overwhelming majority (84%) clicked on the first slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, pretty much everyone is ignoring your carousel and those few who noticed it only see the first slide anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Carousels annoy people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/&quot;&gt;Auto-Forwarding Carousels and Accordions Annoy Users and Reduce Visibility&lt;/a&gt; by Jakob Nielsen, carousels, particularly the ones that auto-rotate, are mostly just frustrating. Users will just move on from the rotator, especially if the rotator is advancing too fast for someone to read and digest all of its information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still want a carousel on your page? I&#39;m not sure why, but consider this point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carousels are terrible for accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is remarkably difficult to make a carousel accessible to everyone, even with all the semantic markup and ARIA attributes that exist. Here is just a quick list of all of the aspects you need to think about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current slide position:&lt;/strong&gt; How do you present which slide the user is currently on? For visual users, you can use bubbles or numbers. For non-visual users, you can announce the slide and its position as it is displayed on the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slide controls:&lt;/strong&gt; How does the user get from one slide to the next? Are there forward and back buttons? Where are they visually? Can you tab to one and then the other easily, if you are not a mouse user? Are these buttons announced if you are not a visual user? Also, for non-visual users, how will you know that these buttons exist in the first place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Handling auto-rotation:&lt;/strong&gt; For starters, never, ever, ever auto-rotate anything. But, if you insist, is there a pause button? Is the pause button obvious? Is the pause button obvious for a non-visual user? How much time does a user get to read a single slide? Is the rotation speed too fast? Too fast means that your user may not have enough time to read the slide. Or interact with it. Or, they do interact with it but they accidentally go to another page because they clicked on the slide as it was rotating. Or the animation is so fast that even someone who is trying to ignore the carousel can&#39;t because it is way too distracting. Seriously, never auto-rotate. Ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading the current slide:&lt;/strong&gt; What is the on the current slide? Is it an image? If so, is that image described adequately for non-visual users? If you have an auto-rotator, is the new image announced to your non-visual users? Is that announcement annoying because the carousel is auto-rotating too fast and a new slide is announced to non-visual users every 10 seconds. &lt;em&gt;(Yet another reason to &lt;strong&gt;never auto-rotate&lt;/strong&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s just the list that I could think of while I am writing this post. There are almost certainly more considerations. If you get any of these things wrong, you&#39;ll likely lose your site visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, perhaps worse, if you suggest adding a carousel to your site, you&#39;ll likely get a resounding &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; from your developer. Your users are sick of looking at them. Your developers are sick of creating them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re still with me here, I would like to suggest an easy alternative to adding a carousel to your page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think about the content on your page.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carousels are a desperate attempt to give the same level of importance to multiple pieces of content. If everything is important, nothing is important. So, think about what is actually important for your users to see. What would thrill you to see your users click on or read?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you decide, make &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; the focus of your page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your users &lt;em&gt;(and developers)&lt;/em&gt; will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overriding WordPress core: Dynamic blocks edition</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/02/core-dynamic-render-override/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently given the task of making the WordPress core RSS block look exactly like one of our custom blocks posts block. That custom block displays a series of news stories. RSS feeds are series of news stories, so this request totally makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, I assumed the task would be a long process of copying and pasting CSS rules from our posts block to classes that match up to the RSS block. That sounded &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt;. Sorry, CSS folks, but CSS is not exactly my happy place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&#39;t help but think, could there be a better way? So, I decided to look for one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An obvious question&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to see if I can just rewrite the core block&#39;s render function to my own HTML (and, more importantly, the CSS classes) to more closely mimic the markup of our custom posts block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After checking out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/packages/block-library/src/rss/index.php&quot;&gt;block&#39;s PHP code&lt;/a&gt;, I wondered if I could simply redeclare the &lt;code&gt;render_block_core_rss()&lt;/code&gt; function. Spoiler alert: PHP did not like that one bit. Unsurprising, but I thought it would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The better way was oddly easy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to find a way to point the core block to a different render function. The only way to assign a render function to a block is upon registration. The block is already registered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But... &lt;em&gt;[Joni puts on her black hat for a moment]&lt;/em&gt; I can unregister and then re-register the block!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&#39;s exactly what I did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;function reregister_block_core_rss() {
  unregister_block_type( &#39;core/rss&#39; );

  register_block_type_from_metadata(
    ABSPATH . &#39;/wp-includes/blocks/rss&#39;,
    array(
      &#39;render_callback&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;rerender_block_core_rss&#39;,
    )
  );
}

add_action( &#39;init&#39;, &#39;reregister_block_core_rss&#39; );

function rerender_block_core_rss( $attributes ) {
  return &#39;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;Whatever I want goes here!&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&#39;;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Further explanation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above code, &lt;code&gt;rerender_block_core_rss()&lt;/code&gt; takes the block &lt;code&gt;$attributes&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter (just as the core render function does) and returns markup. The markup in my above example is obviously not real. This exercise was solely a proof of concept to see whether or not I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; adjust the markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also added a new &lt;code&gt;reregister_block_core_rss()&lt;/code&gt; registration function. This function makes the assumption that the core registration block fires first. It unregisters the block, then reregisters it, using my custom render function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core block is conveniently &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/&quot;&gt;registered via JSON&lt;/a&gt; (a new feature I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;, btw), so my new registration function needs to call that core &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; file. You can access the WordPress installation directory via the &lt;code&gt;ABSPATH&lt;/code&gt; constant. The core block code lives in &lt;code&gt;/wp-includes/blocks&lt;/code&gt;. Put those two together and we have a path to our core RSS block&#39;s JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more note: this method &lt;em&gt;(obviously?)&lt;/em&gt; only works for dynamic blocks &lt;em&gt;(e.g. blocks whose markup are rendered on the server-side)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/register_block_type_args/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;register_block_type_args&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hook that allows you to filter the registration arguments of a block. However, making changes to those arguments does not seem to be a part of that hook. In my testing, the original &lt;code&gt;render_callback&lt;/code&gt; was still being used, so it looks like you would still need to register or reregister the block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tend to work almost exclusively with dynamic blocks these days, but if you have a need to overwrite the render function of a static block, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/render_block/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;render_block&lt;/code&gt; hook&lt;/a&gt; looks to be your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The chaos of time management</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/02/time-management/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a (not exactly) young girl who decided to have a full-time tech job, solo-parent a pre-schooler, and publish a book. &amp;quot;I am so organized!&amp;quot; she exclaimed. &amp;quot;I can totally manage my time to get this done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Act I, scene 1: Hahahaha&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Cue the universe, laughing, saying &amp;quot;Oh really? Hold my beer.&amp;quot;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter school closures. And snow (in the mid-Atlantic, where they think they can handle snow, but they really can&#39;t). And red alert worthy emergencies at work... &lt;em&gt;all month&lt;/em&gt;. And weekend weather so icky, that you need to organize indoor, Covid-friendly activities for the aforementioned pre-schooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Spotlight on a really exhausted human.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next scene: Remembering the excitement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really exhausted human is also at the beginning stages of having her book illustrated. I found a really amazing illustrator and, upon seeing the first drafts of the start of the book, I. Am. &lt;strong&gt;Excited&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still a ton of work to do, but seeing the main characters -- mommy and baby -- in real, illustrated life has made this book feel real. It was a real book before, but practically speaking, it was really just a cute poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am dying to share more about the illustrations, but I am practicing my patience. I promise a cover reveal will happen when the time is right. Just not quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Act II: I have so much to do! Ahhhh!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This excitement has made me realize that I have &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much work to do. Mostly marketing. Constant marketing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how to market anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 20 years, I have been working with code. Not working alone, but certainly not getting other people to buy the things I code. That&#39;s what the marketing department was for.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/02/time-management/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Now... &lt;em&gt;I&#39;m&lt;/em&gt; the marketing department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well... that&#39;s terrifying. What do I do? Shout into the void?&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/02/time-management/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I mean, I&#39;m tweeting more and have 400+ followers now! Yes, I know that&#39;s not a giant amount (and a good amount of my followers are fellow techies) but it&#39;s certainly more than before. I&#39;m pretty excited to have this many. And it&#39;s a good start, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, I do have a (very large) to do list of marketing ideas that I need to get started on. As soon as I have more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Cue the really exhausted human look back at Act 1 of this &lt;s&gt;play&lt;/s&gt; blog post.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least, when I worked for agencies. Not exactly applicable to the higher ed world that I am a part of now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/02/time-management/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are in the void with me and reading this, &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:joni@jhalabi.com&quot;&gt;shout back!&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;d love to hear from you. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/02/time-management/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Imposter syndrome, the sequel</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/01/imposter-syndrome/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking a lot lately about my early career as a developer. Getting a CS degree was hard -- harder than it needed to be. My classes were filled with C++ and &lt;em&gt;(mid-1990s)&lt;/em&gt; Java. Those languages were neither easy or pretty. I learned HTML and CSS on my own. &lt;em&gt;(It was the 90s. Web development degrees didn&#39;t exist then.)&lt;/em&gt; I struggled with (presentational) JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Early career options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about the web was its immediacy. I could imagine something, write some code, and see my imagination appear on the screen. It was magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a while, I thought an art degree was more my speed. I got that degree and promptly realized that art was definitely not for me. So, I started working in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I wrote code. I learned new languages. I re-learned JavaScript alone at least 3 times.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/01/imposter-syndrome/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I moved from a purely front-end developer to an application / functionality layer developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, through most of my career, I had imposter syndrome. I had it so hard. It was worse early on, when I was working with developers who were clearly more senior. I was expected to produce the same quality code. Mentoring would have been awesome, but my jobs were mostly a learn-as-you-go kind of situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, fake it &#39;til you make it, right? Over time, I got better. I wrote better code. I felt better about my code. Imposter syndrome minimized!&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/01/imposter-syndrome/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oh hey, you&#39;re back...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to today. I wrote a children&#39;s book.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/01/imposter-syndrome/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is a book that has been brewing in my brain, and more recently in my computer, for years. It&#39;s not a big book. A picture book in 152 words. But it tells my story of how my daughter came to be. It says things that I say to her all the time. It says things that I have been craving to exist in book form since she was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote and revised and revised and revised. I hired an editor to review it, and then revised and revised and revised some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hired an illustrator and we are starting to put actual pictures in my picture book. We are at the beginning of the illustration process, but we have talked about so many things already. Personal things. Who am I, really? Who is the child in the book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book illustrations that exist in my brain have always been more abstract. I have yet to see myself or my family in a picture book, which is why I wrote one. I want to stay away from things that are specifically me because I want to cast the widest net possible in this very small pond of single parents with donor conceived children. However, the excellent point that being more specific will make the book more authentic has been made. Is that what I am supposed to do? Sacrifice broad strokes that I hope will make the book more inclusive for the sake of authenticity?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who knows me, knows that I have been overthinking this. Am I supposed to treat the book as art or as a small business? I don&#39;t write much. Am I truly a writer if this is the only thing I have written?&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/01/imposter-syndrome/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I have tech degrees from a school that barely had an English department. Why do I think anyone is reading what I am writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh! Hello imposter syndrome, my old friend. It&#39;s been a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fake it &#39;til I make it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this has led me to ask myself the hard question: Why am I publishing this book? I am not querying. I have no publisher. I am self-publishing, so &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is on me. That includes convincing the universe that this book is worth reading, among so much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... why? The entire reason I wrote my book is that it needs to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been looking and, while there are so many books about single-by-choice parent families, there are none that talks to the newborn. Those books talk to the slightly older kids about how they were conceived. The &amp;quot;welcome baby&amp;quot; books talk about their 2-parent families. The &amp;quot;families come in all varieties&amp;quot; book talks about, well, all the varieties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am craving a book that says, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, kiddo! Welcome to this tiny family! Here&#39;s the deal.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; So I wrote one. This is the book that I would have &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; to get at my baby shower. And, hopefully, other parents or soon-to-be parents will love it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I am. Advocating for my vision &lt;em&gt;(to myself and others)&lt;/em&gt;. Researching the logistics of self-publishing. Pretending I know &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; about marketing. Convincing myself to be loud.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/01/imposter-syndrome/#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And, as always, fighting off the imposter syndrome monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least, it feels like I have re-learned JavaScript 3 times. The language has changed so much, I barely recognize my early code now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/01/imposter-syndrome/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s face it. Imposter syndrome never completely goes away. Minimal imposter is the best case scenario inmy book. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/01/imposter-syndrome/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m still a code nerd. I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; wrote a book. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/01/imposter-syndrome/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know blogs count as writing. Not where my brain is going right now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/01/imposter-syndrome/#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; not something that comes naturally. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2022/01/imposter-syndrome/#fnref5&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Motivation block</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/motivation-block/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been meaning to write more, mostly to have some sort of creative outlet that does not involve code. Don&#39;t get me wrong. I love coding and still have about 20 different side projects and ideas that I want to work on. However, writing code for fun after writing code all day for work has not sounded... well... fun these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After writing the manuscript for &lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt;, I realized that I like writing. That is weird to say after years of saying that I hate writing. Maybe I was writing the wrong things. &lt;em&gt;(I&#39;m looking at you, technical documentation.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, of course, after deciding that I really do enjoy writing, I stopped having the motivation for it. To be honest, between work and parenting, I stopped having the motivation for a lot of &amp;quot;extras&amp;quot;. After work is over and mini-me is in bed, I am just &lt;em&gt;tired&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/motivation-block/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; So, I have not written in months. I have a giant list of ideas, but no motivation to work through them. The writing bug decided to hibernate. It&#39;s not quite writer&#39;s block because it feels different. I&#39;ve been calling it &amp;quot;motivation block&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, today happened. After a Covid exposure that quarantined us during Christmas and grounded us from seeing family and celebrating. After the quarantine ended and I looked forward to having a completely quiet house in the in-between days when I am off of work, but the kiddo has (pre)school. After really needing that break of a kid- and work-free day, today happened. A positive Covid test result. Positive despite quarantining for 10 days. Positive despite having no symptoms. We are now in isolation for the few remaining days of my work-free holiday.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/motivation-block/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not going to lie. That wrecked me.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/motivation-block/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; And &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; made me feel guilty because of the implication that I don&#39;t want to spend time with my own child. I love my child. But, every so often, mommy needs a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent pretty much the entire day going between being perfectly fine and perfectly sad. It made me wonder what my kid was thinking when I looked sad. Today was new territory for us. She didn&#39;t say anything and she is the queen of deflecting. Is she sad too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after we finished playing and watching way too much &lt;em&gt;Paw Patrol&lt;/em&gt; and eating dinner and saying night night, I sat down and wrote. I wrote an entire story. I wrote about a girl and about being so sad that you just don&#39;t want to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know if what I wrote will ever see the light of day, but I wrote. I wrote about how I feel and now I feel a whole lot better. That is one strong motivation block cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something something pandemic. Something something collective trauma. Something something it&#39;s been almost 2 years with no end in sight. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/motivation-block/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t worry. Everyone is fine. Asymptomatic Covid is a best-case scenario right now. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/motivation-block/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, for those of you who told me that &amp;quot;this is parenthood&amp;quot;, I have a very specific finger I&#39;d like you to take a look at. Of course you&#39;re right, but that is not a thing to say to someone right in this moment. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/motivation-block/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Research, research, research!</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/research-research-research/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an effort to spend more time on Twitter&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/research-research-research/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I came across a &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/literaticat/status/1470448467063492611&quot;&gt;tweet with the following advice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the library and read 100 books published in your category in the past five years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; I need to do more market research about my book. This is brilliant! I can totally do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Remember what your category is...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh right. My category is children&#39;s book for families with a single-by-choice parent. How do I even search for that? &lt;em&gt;[Types &amp;quot;children&#39;s books for single-by-choice parents&amp;quot; in the search bar]&lt;/em&gt; Ok, there are a bunch. Most of these are even children&#39;s books! &lt;em&gt;(As opposed to books about single parenting for adults.)&lt;/em&gt; And... I have about a third of them already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between Amazon, Goodreads, and some [great compilation pages(&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.topcounselingschools.org/rankings-helpful-books-for-single-mothers-by-choice/&quot;&gt;https://www.topcounselingschools.org/rankings-helpful-books-for-single-mothers-by-choice/&lt;/a&gt;), I can definitely make a solid list. Still nowhere near 100, though. Also, I&#39;m pretty sure I won&#39;t find most of these in the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joys of writing in an obsure and hyper-specific genre, right? Points for uniqueness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let&#39;s get creative!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to expand my search parameters. How about books about the many different kinds of families? Oh! Also, let&#39;s see what Amazon recommends when I search for enough of these books:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An inordinate number of mommy &amp;amp; me books. &lt;em&gt;(A little too exclusive, but this is good stuff.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books about how a baby is made. &lt;em&gt;(This could get interesting...)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religious books. &lt;em&gt;(As an athiest, it&#39;s not exactly where I was going with this, but sure! Why not?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, not all of these are 100% relevant to my exact topic of what is basically a love letter from a solo parent to their baby, but I&#39;m never going to argue with more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let&#39;s get organized!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created -- &lt;em&gt;say it with me&lt;/em&gt; -- a spreadsheet!&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/research-research-research/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I only have 31 books in my list, but this spreadsheet has helped me gather some interesting information about these books so far, even without actually reading most of them just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this spreadsheet, I am recording the book title, author, illustrator, publisher, publication date, and my own random thoughts about the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some interesting insights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon does not always list a book&#39;s illustrator. I know that this is (very likely) on the author or publisher to include that information, so this is not Amazon&#39;s &amp;quot;fault&amp;quot;. However, why not list the illustrator? I know these books have illustrators &lt;em&gt;(because what toddler is going to read an all-text book?)&lt;/em&gt;. So, why not include them? After all, they are a huge part of the book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodreads lists both author and illustrator, which is super helpful. In general, Goodreads is much more useful for finding information about a specific book, but it is easier to find related books (and go down subsequent rabbit holes) on Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have never heard of half of these publishers. I think many of these are actually self-publishing names, which is great because that is my planned route!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A lot&lt;/em&gt; of books were published in 2020. Hooray for pandemic writing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of the rest of these books were published in the early-2000s. There seems to be very little in-between here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let&#39;s start reading!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will have more insights as I actually start reading these books. As I mentioned earlier, I already have a few of these books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am really hoping I can find these books in a library &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;. I would love to just buy all of these books because that is the far easier option, but my budget is giving me a dirty look as I type this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;More time on Twitter? Who &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; that?! Well, I guess I do know since I&#39;m going to have to start marketing this book at some point, right? Twitter is as good a start as any. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/research-research-research/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should surprise no one who actually knows me. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/12/research-research-research/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

      <title>Editing... done?</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/editing-done/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, the text is done! After a few rounds of editing &lt;em&gt;(e.g. many, many, many rounds)&lt;/em&gt; with both alpha readers and a proper editor, I am feeling quite good about it. I&#39;m happy with the message. I&#39;m happy with the story flow. I&#39;m happy with the rhythm of the verses. I&#39;m happy with the rhymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why do I feel like I should &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; be editing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The editing process, to date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editing has definitely been a journey. Looking back, I wrote my first draft nearly 3 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, all of you seasoned writers, please stop laughing. I know that is not that long ago. In my defense, 3 months in pandemic time is roughly 4 1/2 years. I&#39;ve also seemed to have gotten a lot done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 1: Research the publishing process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I strongly felt the need to publish this book since the first (terrible) draft. Well, since before that, if I&#39;m being honest. So, I decided to research the publication process early on to find out exactly what I am getting myself into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First came the research to compare traditional publishing with self-publishing. I ruled out traditional publishing pretty quickly for 2 reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems to be extremely hard to make a profit from it, if I can find someone to accept the book in the first place. I&#39;m not looking to get rich, but breaking even at a minimum is definitely a goal here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a total control freak. That is, perhaps, not the most PC way of phrasing that, but the idea of someone else having a say in major decisions about this book is not something I am comfortable with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-publishing it is! I researched and subsequently spoke with two different self-publishing companies. Both were completely supportive and loved the manuscript, even in it&#39;s first-draft form. One even told me that I should publish the book, even if I do not publish it with them. That comment was almost better than a hug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These self-publishing companies basically guide authors through all of the different steps towards publishing a book: editing, proofreading, illustration, book design, printing, and even warehousing and marketing. Amazing, especially for a first-time author who knows &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; expensive. Prohibitively so, at least for my comfort level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 2: Figure out self-publishing, solo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step basically involved doing comprehensive research on each step of the publication process for a picture book. I used the information I got from the self-publishing companies as a starting point, and then started compiling some giant to-do lists for each step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I am still in this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have a good handle on the logistics of the editing process &lt;em&gt;(more on that in a bit)&lt;/em&gt;, an OK handle on the illustration and book design process, and a giant pile of &amp;quot;figure out this at some point&amp;quot; tasks that pertain to marketing. &lt;em&gt;(Starting this series of blog posts is part of that -- hi!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step 3: Actually editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout steps 1 and 2, I started the editing process because, frankly, my first draft was the book equivalent of pseudocode.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/editing-done/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/editing-done/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, my first draft was a little better than pseudocode, but it needed some changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was editing, I joined &lt;a href=&quot;https://reedsy.com/&quot;&gt;Reedsy&lt;/a&gt;, where is both where I took a few super-beginner &amp;quot;how to publish a book&amp;quot; (free) courses and how I found an editor. My editor was great! She gave me some great honest feedback about my manuscript, which, at the point where she saw it, was around draft 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I also joined the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scbwi.org/&quot;&gt;Society of Children&#39;s Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI)&lt;/a&gt; and posted my draft manuscript there for feedback as well. &lt;em&gt;(The more, the merrier, right?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got quite a bit of feedback there, mostly about the rhythm of my verses. &lt;em&gt;(The book is essentially a poem)&lt;/em&gt; To be honest, I couldn&#39;t hear the issues. It was like having some code that you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; is good, but your browser keeps complaining that it can&#39;t read it. You just know there is a missing semi-colon somewhere, but you have absolutely no idea where because you&#39;ve been staring at it for &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too long.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/editing-done/#fn3&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put the book down for a few weeks, picked it back up, made some edits, then posted the edits. Still more rhythm issues. I. Could. Not. Hear. Them. Frustrated, I decided to rubber-ducky method this problem.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/editing-done/#fn4&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, instead of talking about my problem to the rubber ducky, I decided to sing to my rubber ducky. I made up a tune and sang each book verse to that same tune.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/editing-done/#fn5&quot; id=&quot;fnref5&quot;&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; If I had a hard time fitting the words to the tune, then I would know where my rhythm issues are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, did I find issues that way! Where the rhythm worked (and where it didn&#39;t) became glaringly obvious. I rewrote about half the book after that exercise and, I think, came out with a much stronger book. In my truly unexperienced opinion, I highly recommend trying this if you&#39;re stuck, even if you make up a Gregorian chant for your verses.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/editing-done/#fn6&quot; id=&quot;fnref6&quot;&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; rounds of editing after that, I think I&#39;m done? I mean, I feel like if I continue to edit, I will never be done, which is the classic issue of trying to write an app and waiting to ship it until it is perfect. If you keep tweaking it and tweaking it until you decide it is perfect, you will never actually ship it. Or, at the very least, you will ship it much, much later than you really want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that&#39;s where I am now. I feel like the text is done, or at least done enough. I will likely go through one more round to have someone proofread it, but then I am putting this down to start the illustration process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for my next post, where I talk about using spreadsheets to search for the perfect illustrator! &lt;em&gt;(If you think I&#39;m kidding, just wait.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pseudocode&lt;/strong&gt; is computer-speak for when you write out what you want your function to do before you actually write your computer code. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/editing-done/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that, for the first time possibly ever, my blog will be read by non-technical people. If you have been to literally any other part of my website, you have probably realized that I am a professional nerd. So, welcome non-computer people! I can&#39;t promise that I will not make comparisons between book writing and programming, but I can promise that I will try to explain any nerdisms here. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/editing-done/#fnref2&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punctuation is ridiculously important in most programming languages -- more important than you&#39;d think. This is not true for all of them, but it is in the ones I tend to write in. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/editing-done/#fnref3&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&quot;fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;rubber ducky method&amp;quot; is a strategy that programmers use to solve problems, where we talk to a rubber ducky. Yes, really. We tell a rubber ducky our problem and, in the course of actually verbalizing the problem, we start talking out a solution. It really does work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/editing-done/#fnref4&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a busy year! Between running after my newly-minted preschooler, excitedly settling into life as a fully remote worker, and remodeling our kitchen, you would think I would have time for little else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the same. Then my brain starting talking. &lt;em&gt;Do you remember all of those books that you and mini-you have been reading about how she was made?&lt;/em&gt;, it asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you remember how those books felt just a little too advanced when she was a baby?&lt;/em&gt;, it continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you remember loving, but not feeling seen in all of your &amp;quot;welcome to the family&amp;quot; books that talk about Daddy and &amp;quot;we welcome&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;we love&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;we&amp;quot;?&lt;/em&gt;, it pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yup, you definitely have a point.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We read &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; in this house. I have shelves and shelves of books. Mini-me now also has shelves and shelves of books. Many of her books were gifted; others were my own impulse buys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my goals as a single mother by choice is for my child to never experience a big reveal moment, where she learns about who her biological father is. In fact, she was only a few days old when I first told her about her bio-dad. Not that she remembers that, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a more recent effort to explain the topic to her, I bought and read to her a bunch of single mother by choice books that are specifically tailored for kids.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/am-writing/#fn1&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; However, they &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; feel like a bit too much for mini-me when she was younger. Nothing she could have grasped when she was a baby or even a toddler, for sure. She&#39;s just starting to get it now as a preschooler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I thought about all of the &amp;quot;welcome baby&amp;quot; books that we were gifted, mostly during my baby shower.&lt;sup class=&quot;footnote-ref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/am-writing/#fn2&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; We love those too, but they are all written from that perspective of a 2-parent (usually heterosexual) household. While beautiful, they are mildly awkward for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do something!,&lt;/em&gt; whispers my brain.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OMG brain, listen here. I am &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; busy with everything else. Remember work? And those side-dev projects that I keep meaning to work on? &lt;em&gt;[Cue hysterical laughter from &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; developer reading this.]&lt;/em&gt; And the fact that I&#39;m solo-parenting that aforementioned mini-me? When am I supposed to find time to write a book?!?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, naturally, I wrote a book.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup. Seriously, this nerdy programmer who went to a school that barely has an English department wrote a book. It came to me weirdly quickly in a fit that was about half inspiration and half frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sweet Little You&lt;/em&gt; is a picture book, primarily geared to ages 0-2, that welcomes a new baby to their single-parent family. My goal is for any single-parent family to see themselves in this book, mostly because really want there to be a &amp;quot;welcome baby&amp;quot; book option for families like ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve already had it edited and had a few people informally read it and give comments. And I&#39;ve taken a couple of online classes on how self-publish because (a) that feels like the best route for me because I want to retain full creative control and (b) I have no idea what I&#39;m doing and really needed classes on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, I&#39;m in the process of looking for an illustrator, which is more anxiety-inducing than I imagined it would be. More on that in a future post, mostly because I have quite a bit to say about this process. For now, consider this to be my &amp;quot;coming out as a writer&amp;quot; post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;&lt;ol class=&quot;footnotes-list&quot;&gt;&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-item&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, we enjoy reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/38671815&quot;&gt;For Mommy So Loved You&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53524014-mommy-and-me---how-i-came-to-be&quot;&gt;Mommy and Me How I Came to Be&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/11/am-writing/#fnref1&quot; class=&quot;footnote-backref&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WordPress dynamic block registration, with special guest JSON!</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/10/wordpress-block-json/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My last blog post was about &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/05/wordpress-customization&quot;&gt;WordPress theme customization with JSON&lt;/a&gt;. It seems only fitting that I follow that up &lt;em&gt;(nearly 6 months later... yikes!)&lt;/em&gt; with a new post about custom block registration and, you guessed it, JSON!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-5-8/&quot;&gt;WordPress 5.8&lt;/a&gt; introduced the ability to use a &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; file to register and configure custom blocks. This is a huge step towards minimizing (and possibly eliminating) the amount of JavaScript needed to create a new block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is documentation about &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/getting-started/create-block/block-anatomy/&quot;&gt;block creation&lt;/a&gt;, which now includes information on how JSON fits into this process. There is also documentation about &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/creating-dynamic-blocks/&quot;&gt;dynamic block creation&lt;/a&gt;. Personally, I prefer &lt;a href=&quot;https://2021.wpcampus.org/schedule/dynamic-blocks-ftw-customize-gutenberg-without-living-in-fear-of-validation-errors/demand&quot;&gt;creating dynamic blocks over static blocks&lt;/a&gt;. There is some &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/35918&quot;&gt;pushback and discusson&lt;/a&gt; about this. However, I&#39;m going to leave that for another blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about the journey I just undertook to refactor a custom dynamic block to use &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My original thought process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There appears to be a one-to-one relationship between attributes in &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; and attributes in the JS and PHP block registration functions. Therefore, I thought it was logical to assume that I could simply move those
items into &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt;, remove them from my JS and PHP, and move on with my day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by moving my block meta information, attributes, supports, and example into &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;my/book&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Book Block&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;category&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;text&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;An example block for a book.&amp;quot;,

  &amp;quot;attributes&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;string&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    },
    &amp;quot;author&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;string&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    }
  },

  &amp;quot;supports&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;customClassName&amp;quot;: false
  },

  &amp;quot;example&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;attributes&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Charlotte&#39;s Web&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;author&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;E. B. White&amp;quot;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I updated my JavaScript registration function, so that now it only includes edit and save functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;const { registerBlockType } = wp.blocks;

registerBlockType( &amp;quot;my/book&amp;quot;, {
    edit: ( props ) =&amp;gt; {
        // Edit UI goes here.
    },

    save: () =&amp;gt; {
        // Return null to render in the PHP.
        return null;
    }
} );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I updated my PHP registration function, so that it only includes a call to my render function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;class Book {

  /**
   * __construct()
   */
  public function __construct() {
    add_action( &#39;init&#39;, [ $this, &#39;register&#39; ] );
  }


  /**
   * register()
   *
   * @return void
   */
  public function register(): void {
    register_block_type( &#39;my/book&#39;, [
      &#39;render_callback&#39; =&amp;gt; [ $this, &#39;render&#39; ]
    ] );
  }


  /**
   * render()
   *
   * @param array $attributes Block attributes
   * @return string
   */
  public function render( $attributes ): string {
    $title = $attributes[&#39;title&#39;] ?? &#39;&#39;;
    $author = $attributes[&#39;author&#39;] ?? &#39;&#39;;

    return &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;HTML
      &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;my-book-block&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$title&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$author&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
HTML;
  }
  
new Book;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looks great! I&#39;m all done, right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, I was not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; far off, but this copy-paste-delete approach omits some crucial details. The biggest issue is that neither the JavaScript nor the PHP have any way of knowing that &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; exists. Oops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, first, let&#39;s tell the JavaScript about the JSON. This part is pretty easy, involving 2 steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; into the JS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the block name with the imported JSON in the registration function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following illustrates the change, assuming that both the JSON and JS files live in the same directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;import BookJson from &#39;./block.json&#39;;

registerBlockType( BookJson, {
    ...
} );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to do the same with the PHP. This part is pretty easy as well, again involving only 2 steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the registration function with a new &lt;code&gt;register_block_type_from_metadata()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the block name with the directory location of the JSON file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following illustrates this change, again, assuming that both the JSON and PHP files live in the same directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;register_block_type_from_metadata( __DIR__, [
    &#39;render_callback&#39; =&amp;gt; [ $this, &#39;render&#39; ]
] );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So close!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is looking really good, but the block is still throwing registration errors in the editor. Why?!?! [&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;shakes fist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a (personally) irritating, but easy-to-fix issue. We need to tell both the JSON and the JS what version of the API to use. I suspect this is because the original Gutenberg API did not involve any JSON and adding this new &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; functionality is a &lt;strong&gt;major&lt;/strong&gt; change. A big deal change like this requires a new major version of the API. Since the API seems to default to using the original version, we have to tell it to use the new version (version 2) instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the JS, all you need to do is add &lt;code&gt;apiVersion: 2&lt;/code&gt; to the object passed as the second parameter of the &lt;code&gt;registerBlockType()&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the JSON, all you need to do is add &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;apiVersion&amp;quot;: 2&lt;/code&gt; anywhere in the file. (I tend to add it to the top.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final file versions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And... that&#39;s it! For those of you who just want to copy and paste the final versions of the files, here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;apiVersion&amp;quot;: 2,
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;my/book&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Book Block&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;category&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;text&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;An example block for a book.&amp;quot;,

  &amp;quot;attributes&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;string&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    },
    &amp;quot;author&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;string&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    }
  },

  &amp;quot;supports&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;customClassName&amp;quot;: false
  },

  &amp;quot;example&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;attributes&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Charlotte&#39;s Web&amp;quot;,
      &amp;quot;author&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;E. B. White&amp;quot;
    }
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JavaScript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;import BookJson from &#39;./block.json&#39;;

const { registerBlockType } = wp.blocks;

registerBlockType( BookJson, {
    edit: ( props ) =&amp;gt; {
        // Edit UI goes here.
    },

    save: () =&amp;gt; {
        // Return null to render in the PHP.
        return null;
    }
} );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PHP&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;class Book {

  /**
   * __construct()
   */
  public function __construct() {
    add_action( &#39;init&#39;, [ $this, &#39;register&#39; ] );

  public function render( $attributes ): string {
    $title = $attributes[&#39;title&#39;] ?? &#39;&#39;;
    $author = $attributes[&#39;author&#39;] ?? &#39;&#39;;

    return &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;HTML
      &amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;my-book-block&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;$title&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

      &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
HTML;
  }
  
new Book;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>WordPress customization: Supports and variations and JSON. Oh my!</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2021/05/wordpress-customization/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new WordPress editor &lt;em&gt;(&amp;quot;Gutenberg&amp;quot;)&lt;/em&gt; has been a part of our lives for &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-5-0/&quot;&gt;almost 2 1/2 years&lt;/a&gt;. Since that initial launch, WordPress has come out with so many different ways to customize block editor: &lt;code&gt;theme.json&lt;/code&gt;, block variations, and block supports. These are three distinct features that provide different customization options. Yet, for some reason, I can never remember what controls what (or how much control each feature really has). This blog post aims to clear all that up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;theme.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;theme.json&lt;/code&gt; file is a file that lives at the root of the theme. It allows the theme to control a limited &lt;em&gt;(for now?)&lt;/em&gt; set of block options, including color, typography, and spacing. You can customize each of these options for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; blocks, using a &lt;code&gt;defaults&lt;/code&gt; object, or for a specific block, using that block&#39;s machine name &lt;em&gt;(e.g. &lt;code&gt;core/paragraph&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WordPress developer site has a fantastic &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/&quot;&gt;theme.json how-to guide&lt;/a&gt; that explains the specifics better than I can without plagiarizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What&#39;s the catch?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, this feature is still experimental, which means a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file must actually be named &lt;code&gt;experimental-theme.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experimental features are not merged into core, so the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/&quot;&gt;Gutenberg plugin&lt;/a&gt; must be installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functionality can change at any time &lt;em&gt;without needing to be backwards compatible&lt;/em&gt;, hence the &amp;quot;experimental&amp;quot; label.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But... good news!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature will not be experimental for very much longer. &lt;code&gt;theme.json&lt;/code&gt; is set to be officially, unexperimentally shipped with &lt;a href=&quot;https://wptavern.com/themes-set-up-for-a-paradigm-shift-wordpress-5-8-will-unleash-tools-to-make-it-happen&quot;&gt;WordPress 5.8&lt;/a&gt;, which is set to be released in July 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Block variations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/trunk/docs/reference-guides/block-api/block-variations.md&quot;&gt;Block variations&lt;/a&gt; are copies of an existing block with specific values for their existing attributes or a custom set of child blocks &lt;em&gt;(&lt;code&gt;innerBlocks&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, they were originally named &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/16283&quot;&gt;block patterns&lt;/a&gt;, which appears to be a better name for what the code actually lets you do, but is probably an overall confusing term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get quite a bit of flexibility in terms of customizing variations when you write the base block yourself. For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/packages/block-library/src/embed&quot;&gt;Embed block&lt;/a&gt; appears to give a lot of flexibility to its variations. (The set of Embed blocks was refactored to be variations of the base Embed block as of WordPress 5.6.) Some of this flexibility includes each variation having a distinct icon and title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there does not seem to be a way to get the same flexibility if you want to create new variations of an &lt;em&gt;existing&lt;/em&gt; core block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But.. what if I want to add a new attribute to my variation?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly speaking, nope. Variations are copies with individualized configurations. Think of variations like a block full of Legos. A block with a red Lego and a green Lego can have 2 variations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variation #1 has the red Lego on top and the green Lego on the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variation #2 has the green Lego on top and the red Lego on the bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot create a third variation that adds a blue Lego to the mix. There is no blue Lego.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, however, separately customize the edit UI and add additional attributes to a block. The edit UI customization can be based on which variation that block falls under (using the &lt;code&gt;addFilter(&#39;editor.BlockEdit&#39;)&lt;/code&gt; function), which requires the addition of a custom attribute; for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;const BLOCK = &#39;core/gallery&#39;;

const VARIATIONS = [
  {
    slug:      &#39;grid&#39;,
    title:     &#39;Image Grid&#39;,
    isDefault: true,
    note:      &#39;The images are in a grid.&#39;
  },
  {
    slug:      &#39;gallery&#39;,
    title:     &#39;Image Gallery&#39;,
    isDefault: false,
    note:      &#39;The images are in a carousel.&#39;
  }
];

// Register the variations.
VARIATIONS.forEach( ( variation ) =&amp;gt; {
  registerBlockVariation( BLOCK, {
    name:       variation.slug,
    title:      variation.title,
    attributes: { variationSlug: variation.slug },
    isDefault:  variation.isDefault
  } )
} );


// Add this new &amp;quot;variation slug&amp;quot; attribute, but just to this block.
function addAttributes( settings, name ) {
  if ( name !== BLOCK ) {
    return settings;
  }

  return lodash.assign( {}, settings, {
    attributes: lodash.assign( {}, settings.attributes, {
      variationSlug: { type: &#39;string&#39;, default: &#39;grid&#39; },
    } )
  } );
}

// Update the edit UI based on the current variation.
const updateEdit = createHigherOrderComponent( ( BlockEdit ) =&amp;gt; {
  return ( props ) =&amp;gt; {
    const { variationSlug } = props.attributes;

    // Find the variation of the current block.
    const variation = VARIATIONS.find( ( variation ) =&amp;gt; {
      return variation.slug == variationSlug
    } );

    // Return the updated editor UI.
    return (
      &amp;lt;Fragment&amp;gt;

        { /* Only customize the Inspector if we found a variation. */}
        { variation &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (
          &amp;lt;InspectorControls&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;PanelBody title=&#39;Notes&#39;&amp;gt;
              &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{ variation.note }&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/PanelBody&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;/InspectorControls&amp;gt;
        ) }

        { /* The original edit UI. */}
        &amp;lt;BlockEdit { ...props } /&amp;gt;

      &amp;lt;/Fragment&amp;gt;
    );
  };
}, &#39;withInspectorControl&#39; );


// Finally, the filters that call these functions.
addFilter( &#39;blocks.registerBlockType&#39;, &#39;custom/gallery-attributes&#39;, addAttributes );
addFilter( &#39;editor.BlockEdit&#39;, &#39;custom/gallery-edit&#39;, updateEdit );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to answer the original question, is this possible? Yes. Is this technically still all part of a variation? Not really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Block Supports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block supports are the powerhouse of block customizations. This feature includes an &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/&quot;&gt;extensive list of editor options&lt;/a&gt; that can be overwritten for one or more &lt;em&gt;(or all!)&lt;/em&gt; blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For new, custom blocks, these options can be declared in the block registration function. For existing (core) blocks, these options can be overwritten for any number of blocks using the &lt;code&gt;addFilter(&#39;blocks.registerBlockType&#39;)&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let&#39;s say that you want to remove the ability to add custom class names to a bunch of blocks. You can use the following JavaScript to accomplish this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;const noClassNames = [
  &#39;core/paragraph&#39;,
  &#39;core/image&#39;,
  &#39;my-custom/block&#39;
];

const remove = (settings, name) =&amp;gt; {
  // If the current block is in my list, remove class name support.
  if ( noClassNames.includes(name) ) {
    return lodash.assign( {}, settings, {
      supports: lodash.assign( {}, settings.supports, {
        className: false
      } )
    } );
  }

  // Otherwise, leave it alone.
  return settings;
};

// Filter to add this customization to the block registration process.
addFilter( &#39;blocks/registerBlockType&#39;, &#39;custom/classSupport&#39;, remove );
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;theme.json&lt;/code&gt;, block variations, and block supports are very different, but powerful, features that, I think, are going to make theme and editor customization a whole lot of fun. I hope this clears up the differences among them for you &lt;em&gt;(and also for future-me)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Author&#39;s note: Your interpretation of &amp;quot;fun&amp;quot; may vary.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating block.json for a WordPress block</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2020/11/gutenberg-block-json/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been creating custom WordPress blocks since Gutenberg was in beta, though the vast majority are for work. But this week, I added my very first block to the WordPress block directory. &lt;em&gt;(Hooray for my &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/color-palette/&quot;&gt;Color Palette&lt;/a&gt;!!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can create a plugin that adds a block to your WordPress site. However, developers need to go through a second step to add that block plugin to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/article/block-directory/&quot;&gt;block directory&lt;/a&gt;. The plugin is analyzed to make sure that it meets some basic requirements, one of which is the existence of a file called &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; file allows the block directory to be able to find your block. So, it&#39;s kind of important. It is autogenerated for you if you create your block using the npm command outlined in WordPress&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/&quot;&gt;create a block tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy peasy, but if you are anything like me and enjoy developing from scratch, figuring out the exact requirements for the attributes that go into &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; is difficult, because there is no documentation on its requirements. &lt;em&gt;(It took me four attempts to get it right.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do I even start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the entire purpose of &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; is to register your block with the block directory, much of information in this file comes from the block registration function. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/article/block-directory/&quot;&gt;block directory&lt;/a&gt; support page lists a few single block plugins as examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the code from several of those plugins as a resource. (The Apple Maps block by 10up has a particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/maps-block-apple/trunk/block.json&quot;&gt;detailed example of &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Side note to new developers:&lt;/em&gt; Learn to learn from other people&#39;s code. It&#39;s the best!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;File anatomy: A mostly complete example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following example is the structure I used for my Color Palette block. Feel free to also take a look at my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thatdevgirl/wordpress-color-palette/blob/main/color-palette/source/blocks/colors/block.json&quot;&gt;real &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-json&quot;&gt;{
  &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;my-namespace/my-block&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;NAME OF MY BLOCK&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;description&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;BLOCK DESCRIPTION&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;category&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;my-category&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;keywords&amp;quot;: [ &amp;quot;keyword 1&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;keyword 2&amp;quot; ],
  &amp;quot;attributes&amp;quot;: {
    &amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:  {
      &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;string&amp;quot;
    },
    &amp;quot;content&amp;quot;:  {
      &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;string&amp;quot;
    },
    &amp;quot;showContent&amp;quot;: {
      &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;boolean&amp;quot;
    }
  },
  &amp;quot;script&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;file:relative/path/to/block-registration-script.js&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;editorStyle&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;file:relative/path/to/editor-styles.css&amp;quot;,
  &amp;quot;style&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;file:relative/path/to/front-end-styles.css&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure all of the block information in &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; exactly matches the information in the block registration script. This includes the name, title, description, category, keywords &lt;em&gt;(if applicable)&lt;/em&gt;, and attributes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include all of the attributes, their types, and any default values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; requires at least one script or style to be defined, so define as many of these as you have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The path to the script and style files are file paths that are relative to the location of &lt;code&gt;block.json&lt;/code&gt; in your repository.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if this is 100% correct and/or complete, but it is correct/complete enough to register my block with WordPress and successfully add my block to a site.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Regularly online developer conferences: An impossible post</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2020/06/online-conferences/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a post long in the making, even before the days of our global pandemic and quarantines. In fact, I have been attempting to write this post for &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; long &lt;em&gt;(6 weeks and counting)&lt;/em&gt; that I have deemed this post to be &amp;quot;impossible&amp;quot;. However, before I go there, let&#39;s start with why I wanted to write this post to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love conferences. Developer conferences are the perfect places for me to stretch my geek-legs. I can see what other people are are working on. I can hear different perspectives about development best practices. Occasionally, I even hear interesting debates between competing Javacript libraries. Plus, I love speaking at conferences &lt;em&gt;(which is the ultimate surprise to anyone who knew me 20+ years ago, but that is another story for another time)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having my daughter, my conference attendance drastically decreased. OK, let&#39;s get real. It stopped. Hard stop. I don&#39;t have time to go to conferences. I don&#39;t have a local someone who can take care of a toddler for several days while I am out of town. And, while I love my daughter, the idea of bringing an almost 2-year old to a developer conference frankly sounds like a recipe for disaster and chaos. I would rather save the chaos for home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how I started my search for online conferences. In retrospect, I wish I had started this search much sooner because the appearance of COVID-19 has caused many normally-in-person conferences to go virtual. And this brings me to why this post is &lt;em&gt;impossible&lt;/em&gt;. Every conference is online right now. Every. Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is amazing for someone like me, a conference lover who is unable to travel for conferences. (I mean, assuming you ignore the fact that this is all due to COVID-19.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this also makes it really hard to conduct research on which conferences are always online vs. which ones are just online for right now. This also gives me no insight into what the future holds. &lt;em&gt;(Oh, my queendom for a crystal ball.)&lt;/em&gt; Will previously in-person conferences stay online? Will they also include online streaming options? Will new online-only conferences be born? Or, will conferences double-down on their in-person-ness after we are no longer in pandemic mode?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Always online conferences, the short list.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only time will tell, which means I will probably get back to this post in a year or so. However, I would like to present to you the &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; short list of conferences that I could find and verify that they have been online-only in the &amp;quot;before time&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following list is in no particular order of relevance. &lt;em&gt;(I mean, it&#39;s alphabetical. Is that relevant?)&lt;/em&gt; I am also including the month in which the conference has usually occurred in the past, for reference and convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.developerweek.com/global/&quot;&gt;Developer Week Global&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/&quot;&gt;JavaScript for WordPress Conference&lt;/a&gt; (July)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://woosesh.com/&quot;&gt;WooSesh&lt;/a&gt; (October)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordsesh.com/&quot;&gt;WordSesh&lt;/a&gt; (May)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://online.wpcampus.org/&quot;&gt;WPCampus Online&lt;/a&gt; (January)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>The case of the disappearing Gutenberg</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2020/06/disappearing-gutenberg/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was a WordPress post editor that discovered it had turned into a simple HTML editor....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Apologies to Anne Tyler&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Back When We Were Grownups&lt;/em&gt;.) But in all seriousness, has this happened to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask because this just happened to me. Twice. I logged into WordPress to add a new page and discovered that the Gutenberg editor was gone. No, I did not accidentally install the Classic Editor plugin. Gutenberg simply disappeared. The block library icon was there, but not clickable. The editor had been replaced with a text-only HTML editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/no-gutenberg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress editor, which includes the &#39;Add Title&#39; field, followed by a text-only field with a placeholder saying &#39;Start writing with text or HTML&#39;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;What happened to Gutenberg?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Did I break Gutenberg?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; must be going on with one of my plugins, so I disabled all custom and contributed plugins. Still no Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be my theme? I activated the core TwentyTwenty theme, instead of my custom theme. Nope. Still no Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Umm... is core broken?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the issue was obviously not with any of my custom code or something I installed. Let&#39;s see if core is throwing any errors. I did not see any errors in my browser&#39;s developer console, but my PHP error log was throwing errors about not being able to allocate memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked my &lt;code&gt;php.ini&lt;/code&gt; file. I already set my memory limit to 128MB, which is the maximum recommended limit, but just for kicks, I upped it to 512MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still no Gutenberg. And, adding insult to injury, I was &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; seeing memory allocation errors in my PHP logs. This memory limit issue was already ludicrous, so I concluded that this was unlikely to be the culprit of my Gutenberg issue. This was another issue for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Help me, Obi-Wan Google. You&#39;re my only hope.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turned to the Google and found a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/topic/block-editor-no-longer-working-only-shows-html/&quot;&gt;support requests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/12760&quot;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/126110/visual-editor-missing-server-side-problem-how-would-you-debug-it&quot;&gt;questions&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these suggested troubleshooting techniques that I had already tried, but there were also some new ideas here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resaved my permalinks, which was admittedly a non-sensical longshot. Still no Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cleared my browser cache and cookies. Still no Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I switched browsers. (I had been working in Google Chrome.) Still no Gutenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The (infuriating) eureka moment.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally came across a &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/support/topic/block-editor-no-longer-working-only-shows-html/page/3/#post-11093164&quot;&gt;support topic that suggested the solution&lt;/a&gt;, though it presented itself as a total longshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what was this solution? &lt;strong&gt;Make sure your WordPress user profile has a nickname.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/profile-with-nickname.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;WordPress admin user screen, with the username, first name, last name, and nickname fields. The username and nickname fields are filled out.&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Make sure your WordPress user has a nickname. It is apparently important.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The user nickname is a required field, but, somehow when I created my account, the nickname did not get set. Apparently, being logged in as a user with no nickname causes issues, like &lt;strong&gt;Gutenberg not f$#@$-ing loading&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, remember folks, make sure your WordPress user account has a nickname. Otherwise, WordPress will get angry. You don&#39;t want to make WordPress angry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daily life in the new world</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2020/05/daily-life-in-the-new-world/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;March 23, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That date, almost exactly 2 months ago, was the first day of our new normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new normal is me working from home full time. It is my daughter staying at home full time, no longer in day care with her friends and teachers. It is video chats with friends and family. It is going for walks along the same (mostly deserted) neighborhood streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is spending way too much time in my house and finding all of the home projects that I have been meaning to do when I have free time. It is realizing that I now have &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; free time because I am working and chasing a toddler around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is watching live music over Facebook. It is realizing that I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; watch live music over Facebook without needing to wear a bra. It is high-fiving myself when I realize that the last time I work a bra was March 14. (Not that I am counting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is doing more yoga and discovering that, like my daughter, I can also eat my feet. It is discovering that I am in desperate need of a pedicure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is realizing, &lt;em&gt;oh $#*!&lt;/em&gt;, what was that first point again? I need to figure out how to work from home &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; entertain my child &lt;em&gt;at the same time&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New world routine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are still under &amp;quot;safer at home&amp;quot; orders and we are not really leaving the house anyway. This means that a typical (week)day in our house looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:00am:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Alexa alarm goes off and the lights in my bedroom automatically turn on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:02am:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
I try to remember the word for &amp;quot;snooze&amp;quot;. It usually comes out something like &amp;quot;slooooze&amp;quot;. Alexa calls it close enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:00am:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
I realize that it is 7:00am and start thinking about getting up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:00am:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
I hear my kiddo playing in her room. Crap. I actually get up this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:15am:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Workout, praying the entire time that no catastrophe happens upstairs (i.e. a poop explosion), so I can finish my workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:15am:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Get the kiddo ready for the day. This usually involves saying hello to all of her stuffed animals, reading several books and, eventually, changing her diaper and getting her dressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:45am:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Breakfast. Finally. Seriously, how is she not hungry until now? Books before food? I mean, I have &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; complaints about her love of books, but c&#39;mon. Breakfast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:15am:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
If the weather is nice, we go for a walk around the neighborhood, which usually involves picking up sticks, stealing rocks from my neighbors&#39; yards, and sitting on everyone&#39;s front steps except our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the weather is less than stellar (or, if I&#39;m feeling particularly hermitish), we do &amp;quot;Circle Time&amp;quot;, which involves singing hello, saying our alphabet, and reading &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Pout Pout Fish&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; for the 348th time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:30am(ish):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
I remember that I actually have a job, so I bribe the kiddo with Sesame Street by saying &amp;quot;Elmo?&amp;quot; and watching her jump onto the couch with the remote. Works every time. I log on and start my day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11:00am:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Meeting time for me! We go to the basement, which is basically the kiddo&#39;s play room now. She makes me pretend coffee (because I don&#39;t drink the real stuff), draws on everything with crayons, bribes me with Play-Doh (my guilty play-room pleasure), and generally runs around. I sit on Zoom, sipping my imaginary coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:00pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Lunch time! Perfect timing. The Play-Doh pizza just didn&#39;t cut it for either one of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:40pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Attempt to convince the kiddo that naps are awesome. This usually involves a bit of pretending to nap. Just pretending. Pinky swear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
OMG, the house is &lt;em&gt;quiet&lt;/em&gt;!! I can get some work done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:00pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The kiddo is up. Maybe she can play in her room for a little while while I finish up a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:30pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
I really &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; get her out of her room. Maybe just one more....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:32pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Do I smell poop? Crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:00pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
All clean. Snack time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:30pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Play? Work? Play? Work? Play? Work? Play? Work? Play? Work? Play? Work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:30pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Right, we have to eat dinner at some point. Attempt to bribe the kiddo with more Sesame Street while I cook because, trust me, her in the kitchen only results in her screaming for food while I&#39;m still cooking it. &lt;em&gt;(No sweetie. You can&#39;t have any chicken now. It&#39;s still raw. Just trust me on this one.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6:15pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Dinner time! We made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:00pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
After-dinner play time. This usually involves the vacuum, because she loves the vacuum, unless it is the 3rd Tuesday after a full moon on a day when it is snowing in Canada and someone, somewhere, is eating a banana. Then, forget it. Get that vacuum out of here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:30pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Start convincing the kiddo that it is time for a bath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:40pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
She is still not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:45pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Bribe the kiddo with Elmo during tooth-brushing time because that is literally the only way to (a) get her upstairs and (b) get her to brush her teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:00pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Bath time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:10pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Mommy is drenched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:20pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Everyone (almost) is dry. Time for a bedtime book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:30pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Kiddo is close to asleep. Night-night sweetie!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:45pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
That wasn&#39;t even close to a full work day. I should get some work done. Let me get my laptop out again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:00pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11:30pm:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Waking up and realizing the house is &lt;em&gt;so quiet&lt;/em&gt;. Bed? Code? Bed? Code? Code! Just for a little while, at least. Since I can.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Updating Terminus: A guide for Pantheon users</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2020/03/updating-terminus/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are a developer who hosts your sites on Pantheon, I would be willing to bet that you also use &lt;a href=&quot;https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/&quot;&gt;Terminus&lt;/a&gt;. For all you Terminus users, a message like this probably looks familiar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Terminus 2.2.0
[notice] A new Terminus version v2.3.0 is available.
You are currently using version v2.2.0.
You can update Terminus by running `composer update` or using the Terminus installer:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-installer/master/builds/installer.phar &amp;amp;&amp;amp; php installer.phar update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are like me, you have run that command, only for it to not work at all. The Terminus installer even has an open (as of this writing) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-installer/issues/31&quot;&gt;Github issue&lt;/a&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what do you do? Pantheon does have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/updates/&quot;&gt;troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; page, but those instructions have never worked for me. If you are in the same boat, here are the steps that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; work for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Update Terminus by completely blowing it up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note:&lt;/em&gt; These steps are for Mac users and assume that your Terminus installation lives in your home directory. Adjust accordingly if your installation lives somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to your home directory: &lt;code&gt;cd ~&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rename your existing vendor/ directory (just in case): &lt;code&gt;mv vendor vendor-old&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the Terminus installer: &lt;code&gt;curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-installer/master/builds/installer.phar&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install Terminus: &lt;code&gt;php -d memory_limit=-1 installer.phar install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify that you have a new &lt;code&gt;vendor/&lt;/code&gt; directory in your home directory: &lt;code&gt;ls vendor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify that Terminus has indeed been updated: &lt;code&gt;terminus -V&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should see the latest version number. You should also not see a message saying there is a new version of Terminus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now safe to delete the old Terminus vendor folder: &lt;code&gt;rm -rf vendor-old&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary, though hopefully these instructions will work for you too. Best of luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Besan Block: A long time coming</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2019/08/besan-block/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few times a year, we hold an internal event at work that we call &amp;quot;Serendipity Day.&amp;quot; We use this day, inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://npr.codes/serendipity-at-npr-5fb185bb5864&quot;&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;, to work on projects that are somewhat work related, but have been sitting on our back burners for a while. Sometimes we use this day to research a new topic. More often than not, though, we use this day to build something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Serendipity, take 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a year ago, I decided that for that particular Serendipity Day, I wanted to learn &lt;a href=&quot;https://d3js.org/&quot;&gt;D3.js&lt;/a&gt;. I came up with a project to create charts using D3. I intended the project to be an app for developers. A developer could use it to generate SVG code, to be saved and used separately on a site. I was also working with Google&#39;s API to get data from spreadsheets there because, well, I needed to get data from &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a full day, I was able to learn both Google&#39;s API and D3 well enough to produce a single graph. It was great! I learned so much about SVGs as well, because in the process, I also wanted to make these charts accessible. This involved &amp;quot;getting into the weeds&amp;quot; with both SVG code and D3. However, I became very frustrated with D3. The library, while powerful, felt like a whole lot of overhead just to create SVG code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My intention was to keep working on this project after that Serendipity Day and eventually publish it. Then, life happened and my project remained unpublished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Serendipity, take 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to Serendipity Day this year. Between that earlier Serendipity Day and now, WordPress 5 was released with its new &amp;quot;Gutenberg&amp;quot; core editor. I am now very well versed in the new editor. I have written more custom post editor blocks than I can count. And that charting project from last year is still in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to rewrite my charting project with some major changes. I decided that feeding data from Google was still a good idea. However, I decided to forego D3 and, instead, write the SVG code manually. I also decided that I wanted this project to be a tool anyone could use. I decided to turn this into a custom block for the WordPress editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a decent proof of concept in less than a day. My POC was a plugin that added a new post editor block where an editor can enter in a Google Sheets URL and a column of data to chart. WordPress turned that information into a bar chart that was both navigable by keyboard and readable by screen readers. The chart was an SVG created &amp;quot;by hand&amp;quot; in PHP. &lt;em&gt;Success!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, I was very determined to publish my project because, gosh darn it, this is cool! I found the time to add a settings page to save the editor&#39;s Google API key. I added options to add a chart caption and change the colors of the bars. I cleaned up chart styles. I spent &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; too much time naming this plugin. (&lt;em&gt;Besan&lt;/em&gt;, by the way, is the Vulcan word for &amp;quot;chart&amp;quot;. Live long and prosper.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;OMG. It&#39;s happening!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally&lt;/em&gt;, I submitted my plugin to the WordPress plugin library. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; it was accepted! This plugin is officially live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, I am not done. I have plans to expand the plugin to include more graphs, starting with pie charts as soon as I sit down and actually work out the math around it. Also scatter plots. And line graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/plugins/besan-block/&quot;&gt;Besan Block plugin&lt;/a&gt; in all its bar chart glory and have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I have a dirty little secret: I want to be a junior dev again</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2019/08/dirty-secret-junior-dev/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been a professional developer for 20 years. Actually, I have been writing code for much, &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; longer than that, but I have only been getting paid for it for the last 20 years. In recent years -- especially the last couple of years -- I have noticed my days filling up with other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go to work. I review a build plan for a new feature to a new website that is actually being built out by an outside design firm. My employer cites a lack of enough internal resources to handle this big project. I comment on the build plan, pointing out missing pieces of functionality and asking questions about spots where I have been burned before because I have built out this functionality in a past life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I perform user acceptance testing on code written by this design firm and spend hours in Jira filing bug reports, careful to note steps to reproduce issues. I write detailed rationale as to why the bug should be fixed and take screenshots (and in some cases video) of the issue. I look up WCAG guidelines to back up some of my rationales, since these issues are accessibility concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I code review other people&#39;s code, providing comments about code styles and algorithms, all the while jealous of the developer who submitted this code for me to review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go to our daily stand-up meeting, listing all of the things I will do that day. I include development, as a hopeful side note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sit in meetings to discuss workflows and process. I sit in meetings to discuss &amp;quot;the future&amp;quot;, where we see our websites and infrastructure six months from now. A year from now. Five years from now. I hold architecture planning meetings where we talk about how to get from our current state to &amp;quot;the future&amp;quot;, all the while just trying to keep our current systems afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go home. Some would ask me why I don&#39;t write code in my off hours. I cite everything I have written above, which is, frankly, a mentally exhausting day already. Besides (and more importantly), I want to spend time with my kid when I get home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more to the point, I shouldn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to write code in my off hours to feel satisfied as a developer when I already have a job as a developer. This venting of a post, I&#39;m sure, reads like a series of gripes against my current employer, but I have been down this road before time and time again with a number of past jobs. The problem is with the concept of being a senior developer or, in some previous cases, being promoted to a &lt;em&gt;(gasp!)&lt;/em&gt; manager. As a developer gains experience and seniority, we are pushed towards oversight and planning and away from actual code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me back to my dirty little secret. I want to be demoted to be a junior developer again. I want to go from talking about all of the meetings I went to yesterday and today and tomorrow, to talking about all of the cool stuff I wrote and created. I want my developer job to be a developer job again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Featured images, Gutenberg, and you</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2019/03/wordpress-featured-image-and-gutenberg/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A very common editor update that us WordPress developers make is to add options to the featured image meta box in the post editor. This is usually something like a checkbox to determine whether the featured image should be displayed at the top of a post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The good old (pre-5.0) days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before WordPress 5.0, this was usually accomplished in PHP, using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/admin_post_thumbnail_html/&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;admin_post_thumbnail_html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hook. For a great example of this hook&#39;s usage, check out this article on how to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.billerickson.net/code/add-checkbox-to-featured-image-metabox/&quot;&gt;add a checkbox to the featured image meta box&lt;/a&gt;. However, now that the new core editor (a.k.a. &lt;em&gt;Gutenberg&lt;/em&gt;) is in play, the featured image is now controlled by that new editor. In other words, our reliable old PHP hook no longer works. We now have to modify the featured image box in Javascipt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wait a sec. Did you say JavaScript?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup! Specifically, we need to update the React component that writes out the featured image box. This code is a bit different than what you would write to create a new Gutenberg block. You are still going through the Gutenberg API, but this more closely resembles React than the block registration code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one function, which rewrites the markup inside of the featured image box in the post editor, does all of the heavy lifting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;function setFeaturedImageDisplay( OriginalComponent ) {
  return ( props ) =&amp;gt; {

    // Get meta field information from the DB.
    let meta = select( &#39;core/editor&#39; ).getCurrentPostAttribute( &#39;meta&#39; );

    // Create featured image display option field.
    const displayOption = withState( {
       isChecked: meta.featured_image_display,
     } )( ( { isChecked, setState } ) =&amp;gt; (
       &amp;lt;CheckboxControl
        label = &#39;Display this image at the top of the page.&#39;
        checked={ isChecked }
        onChange={ ( isChecked ) =&amp;gt; {
          // Update the field in the editor.
          setState( { isChecked } );

          // Save the new value to the DB.
          meta.featured_image_display = isChecked;
          dispatch( &#39;core/editor&#39; ).editPost( { meta } );
        } }
      /&amp;gt;
    ) );

    // Return the entire featured image box.
    return (
      createElement( &#39;div&#39;, { }, [
        // Display the original featured image box.
        createElement( OriginalComponent, props ),

        // Add a checkbox below the featured image to control display option.
        createElement( displayOption )
      ] )
    );

  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, all you need is to add a hook in your JavaScript to update the featured image block in the post editor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;wp.hooks.addFilter( &#39;editor.PostFeaturedImage&#39;, &#39;MY-NAMESPACE/featured-image-display&#39;, setFeaturedImageDisplay	);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You still get to write (a little) PHP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news everyone! You still need to write some PHP to register the meta field with WordPress. This uses the &lt;code&gt;register_meta&lt;/code&gt; function. You can put this anywhere in a custom plugin or your theme, but I recommend adding this to the same plugin where your JavaScript lives, to keep your code all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-php&quot;&gt;function set_featured_image_display() {
  register_meta(
    &#39;post&#39;,

      <title>A very informal look at Gutenberg accessibility</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/10/a-very-informal-look-at-gutenberg-accessibility/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have been working all year to replatform our websites at work from Drupal to WordPress. We decided to go with WordPress for many reasons, one of the biggest being its admin UI.  The WordPress edit screen, especially when compared to the Drupal edit screen, has historically been intuitive and preferred by content editors. In fact, many of my clients in the past have asked to switch their websites from Drupal (or similarly complex systems) to WordPress because of WordPress&#39;s UI advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WordPress 5.0 and Gutenberg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent updates to the upcoming WordPress 5.0 release, specifically the new Gutenberg editor, appears to be undoing these advantages. I have been working with Gutenberg in development since the start of our replatforming project. The UI has so much promise in terms of allowing editors to add, remove, and rearrange content blocks on pages. The UI is clunky, but it has been getting so much better over the course of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I say this as a (mostly) fully abled user. &lt;em&gt;(I mean, I have been having age-related sight issues lately, but otherwise, I am fully capable of navigating the web without assistive technology.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gutenberg and accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutenberg has been controversial from its inception. However, &lt;a href=&quot;https://rianrietveld.com/2018/10/i-have-resigned-the-wordpress-accessibility-team/&quot;&gt;Rian Rietveld&#39;s recent blog post&lt;/a&gt; about her resignation from the WordPress accessibility team has brought Gutenberg&#39;s accessibility issues into the spotlight. There seems to be a myriad of issues here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lack of development education about accessible development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental flaws in the editor&#39;s UI design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lack of governance around enforcing &lt;a href=&quot;https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/accessibility-coding-standards/&quot;&gt;WordPress accessible coding standards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are calls from the community to perform an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/10318&quot;&gt;accessibility audit on the Gutenberg editor&lt;/a&gt;. However, regardless of whether the audit will happen or not, it seems that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/10318#issuecomment-429106511&quot;&gt;accessibility concerns will not delay the release of 5.0&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bamadesigner/status/1050496609639952384&quot;&gt;I mean, really. Really?&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Curiosity is getting the better of me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this talk about Gutenberg&#39;s lack of accessibility has me very curious as to how bad the editor is. So, I decided to take a quick peek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am running this very informal audit on my work machine, which is a MacBook Pro, running OS 10.14 (Mojave). My web browser of choice is Chrome, which as of this writing, is up-to-date at version 69.0.3497.100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My development environment is running WordPress 4.9.8, with the Gutenberg plugin, version 3.9.0. Both core WordPress and the plugin are up-to-date as of this writing. For the purposes of this test, I ensured that Gutenberg is the only installed and activated plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automated testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a new post to my site and then ran the &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/siteimprove-accessibility/efcfolpjihicnikpmhnmphjhhpiclljc?hl=en-US&quot;&gt;Siteimprove Accessibility Checker Chrome extension&lt;/a&gt; on the page to search for all A and AA level issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
![The WordPress post edit page with the Siteimprove Accessibility Checker running](/assets/images/posts/gutenberg-siteimprove.jpg)
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I added a paragraph block to the page, Siteimprove found 54 instances of level A issues and 5 instances of level AA issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Level A issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 5 types of level A issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1.1 Non-text content&lt;/strong&gt; (23 instances)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of these instances were hidden SVG images with no alt text.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3.1 Info and relationships&lt;/strong&gt; (10 instances)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 instance was regarding the use of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to format text. I do not view this as necessarily an issue because this tag has valid semantic meaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 instances of element IDs not being unique. This is definitely a big issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 instances of content outside of landmarks. This is also definitely an issue, especially for screen reader users who rely on landmarks to navigate the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.4.4 Link Purpose (in Context)&lt;/strong&gt; (14 instances)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of these instances involve the same link text being used for multiple different destinations. This is an issue for screen reader users, who can view a list of links out of context and will expect that multiple links with the same title to go to the same place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.1.1 Parsing&lt;/strong&gt; (6 instances)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a duplicate issue of the 6 instances of non-unique IDs that were flagged above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.1.2 Name, Role, Value&lt;/strong&gt; (1 instance)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This instance is on the text box used to enter paragraph content. This text box is using the &lt;code&gt;aria-expanded&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which is not appropriate for text boxes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Level AA issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was only 1 type of level AA issue that was flagged:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.4.7 Focus visible&lt;/strong&gt; (5 instances)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of these instances involved elements not being highlighted on focus. This is a huge issue for keyboard users, who rely on these highlights to know where they are on the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if I do something more complicated?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran the checker after adding other kinds of content blocks, such as the Image block. In all cases, I found the same &lt;em&gt;kinds&lt;/em&gt; of issues, but differing numbers of instances, depending on the block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manual testing with a keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automated testing is great for a start, but a real accessibility test involves attempting to navigate a page as a human using assistive technology. My first such test was as a keyboard user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to attempt to create a post with a paragraph and an image using only my keyboard. I started the test already on the &amp;quot;new post&amp;quot; page. My goal was to add a paragraph block and an image, and then save the page using only my keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding a page title&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started tabbing and immediately saw the skip links. Great! I skipped to the toolbar. At first, I had no idea where I was because nothing had focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After tabbing once, I realized that I was on the horizontal bar at the very top of the screen. I kept tabbing through that bar and eventually tabbed through to the &amp;quot;Add block&amp;quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I wanted to add a title first, so I kept tabbing until I got to the title input area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And... I successfully added a title! Great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding a paragraph&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept tabbing and for some reason, tabbed up the page to the section where I can copy the permalink. This section is &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; the page title input, but, since I tabbed to it &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the page title, it must exist after it in the DOM. Not unusable, but definitely strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
![The WordPress post edit page after tabbing to the permalinks section](/assets/images/posts/gutenberg-permalinks.jpg)
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost focus for a tab, but did get to the part of the block where I could enter paragraph text. And... I successfully added a paragraph!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even though I saw the formatting toolbar for the paragraph (where I can align the text and bold/italicize, etc), the toolbar disappeared as soon as I started typing. Moreover, when the toolbar was visible, I could not figure out how to tab into it to actually use any of those formatting functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tabbed back and forth several times to try to figure it out. Eventually, I figured out that if I tabbed &lt;em&gt;backwards&lt;/em&gt; into the page title, then forwards again, I was able to tab into the toolbar. I could align the text left, right, or center at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was only able to somewhat able to add bold or italicized text, but the bold/italicized text was forced to the start of the paragraph content because, when I tabbed to the toolbar, my cursor &lt;em&gt;(for whatever reason)&lt;/em&gt; moved to the start of the paragraph content (even if it was in the middle of the content). I was able to select and bold or italicize specific words in my content, using &lt;code&gt;Command-B&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Command-I&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another weird thing I discovered was that I could tab backwards from the paragraph block to the page title input, skipping the permalink section. However, when I tabbed forwards from the page, I tabbed into the permalink section first, before getting back to the paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding the image block&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to adding an image was adding the image block. That was... special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new paragraph block was created after I pressed &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt; after my first paragraph block. That would be super convenient if I wanted another paragraph. I was able to easily tab into the section of &amp;quot;most used&amp;quot; (or &amp;quot;recently used?&amp;quot;) Gutenberg block buttons above the new paragraph block. One of these block buttons was for the Image block, but since the buttons in that section changes, I viewed that as somewhat cheating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to try to add the Image block using the regular &amp;quot;Add Block&amp;quot; button. But first, I had to get to that button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are actually 2 &amp;quot;Add Block&amp;quot; buttons: one to the left of the currently selected block and one at the very top of the edit screen. I went for the one on the selected block first. I was able to tab to that button, but after tabbing through the &amp;quot;most used&amp;quot; block buttons. That worked, but it was an odd experience, since I expected to tab between elements from left to right, top to bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
![The add block button next to the paragraph block](/assets/images/posts/gutenberg-add-block.jpg)
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got to the &amp;quot;Add block&amp;quot; button, I successfully searched for the image block and added it to the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding an image&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took quite a bit of tabbing to get to the &amp;quot;Media Library&amp;quot; button inside the image block. (I first had to tab through the block&#39;s toolbar, which did persist, unlike the paragraph block.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding an image via the Media Library was very straight forward. I was able to tab to my image, select it using &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt;, edit any caption or alt text, and add the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; (and this is a huge &amp;quot;but&amp;quot;), the image block has a lot of options in its inspector control panel.  I have no idea how to tab to those options. I can see them, but as soon as I tab through the image block, I tabbed through the next element in my post (another paragraph block).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
![The image block and its inspector panel](/assets/images/posts/gutenberg-image-inspector.jpg)
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that last block, I was able to tab into the inspector panel, but it was the inspector for the paragraph block at the end of my post, not the image block in the &lt;em&gt;middle&lt;/em&gt; of my post.  I was unable to figure out how to tab to the inspector controls of any block that was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the last block of the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Publishing the page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am done with trying to figure out  the options for my image, so I am just going to publish this post. I tabbed out of the last block of my post and discovered a skip link labelled &amp;quot;Open publish panel&amp;quot;. Well, now. That is convenient!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I clicked on that skip link and the publish panel opened. The &amp;quot;Publish&amp;quot; button had focus and was highlighted (though, the highlight blended into the button). I pressed enter and -- &lt;em&gt;voila!&lt;/em&gt; -- my post was published!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost focus after the post was published, but one forward tab took me to the &amp;quot;Close panel&amp;quot; button for the publish panel. I lost focus again when I closed that panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I wanted to view my new post. It took a lot of finagling with forward and backward tabbing to figure out how to get to the &amp;quot;View Post&amp;quot; link at the top of the page, but eventually I got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Screen reader testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really should test this process using a screen reader too, but, frankly, just testing with the keyboard was a lot of work. If time allows later (soon?), I will run the same test with a screen reader and post about it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions (so far)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears the Gutenberg did think about &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; accessibility features, but it is very clear that no complete accessibility testing was performed. The points of frustration for me in this short experiment where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tabbing did not necessarily follow the logical sequence of top to bottom, left to right. The order of tabbable elements appeared to skip around a bit, mostly when new items, like toolbars, became visible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toolbars were pretty usable when they were visible, but the fact that the paragraph toolbar kept disappearing on me was very frustrating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fact that I was completely unable to tab into the inspector panel options for all blocks that were not the last block on the page is a huge issue. IMHO, that is a blocking issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community has also logged a bunch of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+tab+label%3AAccessibility&quot;&gt;Gutenberg accessibility issues&lt;/a&gt; and I suspect this list will grow once (if) an accessibility audit is performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I like Gutenberg. Well, really, I like the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of Gutenberg. There are definitely quirks in the UI for all users and very definitely issues for users with accessibility needs. I hope the editor gets better, but it seems that the fixes will require large systemic changes, which will take a lot of time. I would love it if Gutenberg launched &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; fixing these issues, at the very least to get the editor to WCAG A compliance before launch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Final public postpartum thoughts</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/08/final-public-postpartum-thoughts/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wanted to update this category in my blog one more time before &amp;quot;signing off&amp;quot;. I could blog all day and night about Amelia, but I also want to keep most aspects of her life private. That means, off Facebook, off Instagram, off whatever other social media platforms exist that I&#39;m &amp;quot;too old&amp;quot; to use, and off this blog. Sorry folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;12 Days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia is 12 days old now. She changes literally every day. I&#39;m excited to see how she will grow and change in the days/weeks/months/years to come, but I am also sad because I miss how she was just a week ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have learned some very important things about myself over the last 12 days. The first is that, before Amelia arrived, I was super OCD about how I kept my house. Now... not so much. I mean, not at &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;m not saying my house is a train wreck. (Anyone who knows me in real life knows that will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; happen.) However, I am less OCD about things like spills. Or random clutter. It&#39;s freeing, to be honest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second, and more surprising thing, that I&#39;ve learned is that &lt;strong&gt;OMG I really love babies!&lt;/strong&gt; I mean, while I was pregnant, I was &lt;em&gt;dreading&lt;/em&gt; the first couple of years of Amelia&#39;s life. I&#39;ve wanted a baby for so long, but I knew absolutely nothing about them: how to feed, how to change a diaper, what they want, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am in the midst of &amp;quot;newborn central&amp;quot;, I don&#39;t want it to end. I love the wide-eyed, open mouthed look that she gives me every so often when we are eating. (This is despite the fact that I have come to learn that is her pooping face. LOL.) I love the baby side-eye that she gives me when I say or do something kinda dumb. I love the almost-smiles I get when I am being silly with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been taking roughly a million photos of her a day. Videos too, in my fool-hearted attempt to capture these looks accurately. Digital media isn&#39;t doing these looks justice, so I&#39;m working on memorizing everything about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia will have her own &lt;em&gt;(private, invitation-only)&lt;/em&gt; blog &lt;em&gt;(curated by mommy)&lt;/em&gt; soon. As I said earlier, in the interest of privacy (assuming people really do read this blog!), this will likely be my last entry about her on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all for reading! It&#39;s been quite the ride since my first entry over a year and a half ago. Feel free to share &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/pregnancy/&quot;&gt;my pregnancy archive page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pregnancy vs. postpartum</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/08/pregnancy-vs-postpartum/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the last week, since my daughter&#39;s birth, I have discovered that I have become &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; used to being pregnant. This realization is becoming more and more apparent as I heal from my c-section and I regain more general mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I can bend over and touch my toes. &lt;em&gt;(Thank goodness, because my toenails are so long, they could be weapons. But I digress.)&lt;/em&gt; Whenever I do bend over, I keep thinking, &lt;em&gt;Oh no! Am I going to squish the baby?!?&lt;/em&gt; This is a thought I had frequently during my pregnancy, as though I could squish the baby&#39;s head by moving in the wrong way. Of course, then I realize that the baby is no longer actually in my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know. &lt;em&gt;Duh, mom. You gave birth. Of course the baby isn&#39;t in your body.&lt;/em&gt; But the feeling is still reflexive. Give me a break. It&#39;s only been a week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Oh hello, hormones</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/08/oh-hello-hormones/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was an incredibly bad day. I have read about postpartum depression. It is something I had been worried about for the majority of my pregnancy because of my history of anxiety. A friend of mine even talked to me about it way before I delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week -- the week I delivered -- was complete insanity between the surprise c-section, meeting and getting to know my new daughter, and the subsequent hospital stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, yesterday everything hit me &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt;. Like, ton of bricks times twelve, hard. I can list off so many quantifiable reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a new baby!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not to mention this is my first baby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plus I have not had a whole lot of exposure to babies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My mom is here helping me out with things, but that has turned into her taking over my house. Considering I have lived alone for the past 14+ years, I am not OK with that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of the c-section, I have had mobility issues since the delivery. For someone who is both independent and very active &lt;em&gt;(oh my goodness, I miss running!)&lt;/em&gt;, this is slowly killing me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been able to handle all of this... kind of. What really sets me off into a meltdown-grade sobbing fit is actually thinking about my daughter. &lt;em&gt;(Seriously, I&#39;m crying as I&#39;m writing this right now.)&lt;/em&gt; She is beautiful and perfect... and I don&#39;t want her to change. I love her so completely when I see her as she is now. However, when I think about her in the future -- months from now, years from now, all grown up -- I break down. I know I will love her then just as much as I do now, but I also don&#39;t want her to change at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her crazy, raging, snuggling newborn self is amazing. I really just want to freeze time and live with her in this moment forever. It breaks my heart that she&#39;s going to change so quickly, even though that change will also be beautiful and exciting. I want to remember the way she looks right now. I want to remember the weird old-man face she makes just before she starts crying. I want to remember how her voice sounds in this moment.  I want to remember how she looks at me when she snuggles in for a nap on my chest. I am recording everything because I don&#39;t want to forget a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Nicknames</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/08/nicknames/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My daughter is only a few days old, but over the course of the past few days, I have been calling her by all sorts of nicknames. On top of that, my friends have also been donning her with even more nicknames. This girl has so many nicknames flying around, that I decided I needed to record all of these names somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little Miss&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Little String Bean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Girly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Girly Girl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cutie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burrito&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pumpkin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Little Miss Squirmy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Baby Doll&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Little Ninja&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Little Yogi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweet Pea&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baby Doll has been my recent favorite. I&#39;m not sure why.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Delivery</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/08/delivery/</link>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;Monday: The Induction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was the day where we get this delivery ball rolling! I reported to the hospital that afternoon (after working my last day at work... from home, of course, but it was a great distraction). After a whole lot of paperwork, I was admitted to Labor and Delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got hooked up to all the monitors. Tests happened. My OB came. Everyone confirmed that my cervix was still very much closed. And then the induction started with a small thing that was shoved all the way up my cervix and left there for 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started cramping. I felt some contractions but, for the most part, the cramps just felt like one large period. A couple of friends came to visit. I slept. I was told nothing would really happen until the next day anyway. So far, so good?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday morning: What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day, another exam. I was hoping to be at least a little dilated today, but nope. The OB checked and say my cervix was a bit softer (good news!), but my pelvic bones are very close together. As in, too close. A baby -- even a small one -- has no chance of fitting through my tiny pelvis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... c-section it has to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;That was unexpected: A gross understatement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan through my entire pregnancy was to have a vaginal delivery. Not like I had a proper birth plan. My “birth plan” was basically to get the kiddo out of me as safely as possible and to give me as many drugs as possible along the way. We all agreed that vaginal was the most likely route because it would be the least traumatic for everyone, since that’s the natural way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one expects a ridiculously tiny pelvis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday afternoon: Surgery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a (more than) mild amount of freaking out, it was finally time for the c-section. Let me tell you, my panic attacks were pretty epic. This was my first surgery &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;. My first time on anesthesia. My first major panic attacks in about 15 years. Oh, and I had to finally come out to my mom about my anxiety diagnosis (from 2001). Which was... ~great~ ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked (yes, walked!) into my first OR ever, where I chatted with the anesthesiologist about music. As one does. He likes to jam during surgeries. (Really, I think he must have read my mind.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying to explain my taste in music (I mean, I rarely find another fan of folk and bluegrass music “in the wild”), he plugged “contemporary folk” into Pandora and we were in business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First song up: &lt;em&gt;One Voice&lt;/em&gt; by the Wailin&#39; Jennys. The perfect start. (Incidentally that song is still earwormed 2 days later and occasionally makes me cry. Love it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt myself slowly go numb from the chest down. They erected a giant curtain in front of my face at some point and stretched my hands out. I closed my eyes and zoned out to the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually don’t remember too much from the procedure itself. I never felt the incision. I remember someone (the anesthesiologist, I think) saying that he saw her head. Something by Norah Jones was playing on Pandora. (For the life of me, I can’t remember which song, but I really wish I could remember that.) I heard her cry. Briefly. She was actually a really chill baby considering, well, the birth process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amelia Jade Halabi was born on Tuesday, July 31, 2018, at 1:40pm. She was tall and skinny at birth, measuring in at 21” and weighing 6lb 14oz. She was born with a head full of medium brown hair and, surprisingly, gray eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will write more later about her first couple of days of life. It’s been a long, but wonderful, couple of days. She has a full head of straight brown hair. &lt;em&gt;(I’m sure it will curl as soon as we leave the hospital.)&lt;/em&gt; She has gray eyes. She is a master of eating, sleeping, and, of course, crying her brains out. She is doing great job at keeping us on our toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am trying to piece together the playlist from Amelia&#39;s delivery. Dorky, I know, but music is realy important to me. Here is what I remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Voice&lt;/em&gt;, Wailin&#39; Jennys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Take Me Back&lt;/em&gt;, Sarah Jarosz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Promise&lt;/em&gt;, Tracy Chapman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;???&lt;/em&gt;, Norah Jones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Induction day!</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/07/induction-day/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s Induction Day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I check into the hospital at 4pm today to get induced. As far as I can tell, we are still starting from 0. My belly has not dropped. I am not having contractions. My water has not broken. I am guessing I am not dilated. The kiddo is still kicking high. I suppose she really likes it in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry kid. Time to go.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Almost there</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/07/almost-there/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My last high risk appointment was yesterday and my last OB appointment was today. Actually, I should say &lt;em&gt;appointments&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Today&#39;s (last!) OB visit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw my doctor and we had a great conversation about my due date and upcoming induction, during which I learned a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My cervix is very small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My belly is very... not small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The kiddo is very far up my pelvis, meaning she is not ready to make her entrance (or exit, depending on your perspective).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything is still closed up anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are still aiming for a vaginal delivery, but if the kiddo is too big, that will not be feasible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;Too big&amp;quot; means 9 lb. or over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also, the kiddo not only needs to be head-down, but she also needs to be facing my spine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the last time the kiddo was measured was 3 weeks ago &lt;em&gt;(at 6lb.)&lt;/em&gt;, so we have no idea how much she weighs right now. So... time for another sonogram!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weighing in at...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of a couple of hours ago, the kiddo weighs 7 lb. 2 oz. ... give or take 1 lb. I&#39;m not sure how I feel about a 14% margin of error. (I mean... that&#39;s a lot of error.) However, since the maximum current weight is still well under that 9 lb. threshold, out the vagina she will go! (For now.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kicking</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/07/kicking/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friends and I code-named the kiddo &amp;quot;Lord Kick Ass&amp;quot; sometime in my second trimester because, in addition to the fact that she started kicking right around then, we are certain that she will, indeed, kick ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I approach my final week of pregnancy, I am finding that Lord Kick Ass is becoming more and more true to her name. During last week&#39;s doctor appointment, she decided that the early morning was a fine time to kick ass. She was so active, the doctor could not get a baseline heart rate on her (which she has to stay relatively still for).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, however, was an anomaly. LKA generally prefers to kick ass in the evenings and early mornings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is 9:38pm. I can feel one foot kicking the bottom of my rib cage. I come very close to peeing myself when she stretches into my bladder. I can see her other foot sticking out of my stomach. If I press down a little on that area, I can feel her actual foot through my belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find myself wanting to write all of these things down because I don&#39;t want to forget any of this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Induction scheduling</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/07/induction-scheduling/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just left one of my final OB appointments. This particular appointment involved a cervical exam to see if I am dilated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;#TIL...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned three important things from this exam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not dilated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not only am I not dilated, but apparently everything down there is swollen too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During such an exam, I am not a fan of my doctor saying, &amp;quot;Oh, your cervix is all the way over there.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the kiddo &lt;em&gt;(who, by the way, was also not a fan of this exam)&lt;/em&gt; is not yet making any moves to vacate the premises on her own, the delivery of her eviction notice has been scheduled. They call this a preinduction with cervical ripening. Because, you know, my cervix is just like produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless I go into labor in the next week, I have an appointment to arrive at the hospital the evening of Monday the 30th. At that time, I will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be admitted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have one of my OBs start the induction process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait overnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See what happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lord Kick Ass&#39;s arrival!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically, this process takes 2 days, but who knows. I will either deliver on the 31st or the 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This appears to be the most likely birth scenario. I feel kind of bad for my friends who placed bets that the kiddo will come early (i.e. next week).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The waiting game</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/07/waiting-game/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am 37 weeks today and the wait is killing me. I know she&#39;s coming out soon and I think my belly is starting to drop, but the kiddo has not made her move yet. It seems she&#39;s not even close. I mean, even my Braxton-Hicks contractions have toned themselves down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kiddo is kicking more, true to her code name (Lord Kick Ass). The kicking is mostly in my ribs (right side only), but I think that is because she is already head down and, frankly, her legs have nowhere else to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am actually pretty torn about the waiting game of these last few weeks. On the one hand, she is so much more portable while she is on the &amp;quot;inside&amp;quot;. On the other hand, I really can&#39;t wait to meet this tiny human that has been inside my belly for so long, to see what she&#39;s really like in &amp;quot;real life&amp;quot;. (Also, I miss sleeping on my stomach.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Q &amp;amp; A time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been getting a lot of questions from friends (and the occasional stranger) now that I am towards the end, so here are some FAQs for you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What cravings are you having?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None. Seriously. I think I&#39;m defective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m totally eating up a storm. I&#39;m just not craving anything in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except ice. Is that a craving? My ice maker has been working overtime the last couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you about to give birth right here in my living room?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. I&#39;m pretty sure it doesn&#39;t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&#39;re so active. WTF?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea. It probably has something to do with the fact that I was running up through week 30-ish. I&#39;m even still working out, for some definition of &amp;quot;working out&amp;quot;. Frankly, I&#39;m just thankful that I&#39;m not a giant blob on the couch. &lt;em&gt;(I know that sounds like heaven to some of you all, but that would be torture for me.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you dealing with the massive heat we&#39;re having?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air conditioning. As an introvert, I don&#39;t want to leave the house anyway. So... win-win?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ready for go time... kinda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bags are packed and in the car. Technically &lt;em&gt;(as in, on paper)&lt;/em&gt; I am ready for the kiddo to come. Mentally... that is another story. To be honest, childbirth hasn&#39;t really hit me yet &lt;em&gt;(though, I&#39;m sure it will soon!)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pre-postpartum thoughts</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/07/pre-postpartum-thoughts/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I enter the last month of my pregnancy, I have this recurring and overwhelming thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy crap! I will not be pregnant this time next month.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of having a tiny human inside my body, I will have a tiny human outside my body. Ignoring all of the crazy that comes with &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; realization, I find myself thinking a lot about how I&#39;m going to feel about my body after the kiddo is out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I have an excuse for my klutziness.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always been... let&#39;s call it &amp;quot;less than graceful.&amp;quot; These days I have no abs (because I have been terrified to do any kind of ab work). I use a combination of arm strength, momentum, and (at the last minute) gravity to get myself out of bed. Thank goodness I live alone, because it is a comedy act that no one needs to see. I am hoping to be more agile after the kiddo&#39;s arrival, but... let&#39;s face facts. This is me. Agile is not my middle name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I have an excuse for my shape.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s face it. I have never been a stick figure. I have even been mistaken for being pregnant when I very definitely wasn&#39;t. &lt;em&gt;(I have written about this before. Again, please do not congratulate a woman on being pregnant until after the baby has been born. Although, I suppose during the delivery process is acceptable too.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know my body is going to change and it is not going to change back to what it was pre-pregnancy. Before, I was having anxiety over my pregnancy body. Now I&#39;m starting to have anxiety over my post-pregnancy body. I&#39;m learning to be gentle with myself and my shape, but &lt;em&gt;(and again, I have written about this before too)&lt;/em&gt; that will be a long journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I get my kicks....&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have gotten really used to having someone kick me from the inside. Sometimes it is wonderful. Other times it is incredibly distracting. (I mean, distracting to the point where I can no longer think.) Regardless, I am very used to feeling her every so often, and more often every day now. I think I am going to miss that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In the meantime...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am starting to get really excited for the kiddo&#39;s arrival. Every day, it feels more and more real, from seeing her room fill up with her things, to sorting her bottles, to feeling my stomach contract. And then, a couple of days ago, I got to see her actual face for the first time, thanks to a 3D ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/ultrasound-week-36.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ultrasound image of the kiddo at week 36&quot; :width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean... she has a face! A real human face!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, this photo made her more real to me than anything, including all the kicking. I can&#39;t wait to meet her in real 3D.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feelings from the inside</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/06/feelings-from-the-inside/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It just occurred to me that I haven&#39;t written about what it feels like to actually have another human growing inside you. To be honest, I&#39;m not even sure how to describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I don&#39;t feel her at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like a rumble in my belly. It is both kind of like indigestion and nothing like indigestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes she is playing the drums against the side of my belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes she kicks or punches so hard that I can see a bulge coming out of my belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that she has flipped to be head-down, I routinely feel her feet get stuck in my rib cage. When that happens, I can usually push down on the right-side of my abs and move her feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone asked me where her head is the other day. I can feel her head. It is nowhere appropriate. &lt;em&gt;(Again, she&#39;s head down now.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, sometimes I feel my entire belly squeeze and tighten up. Oh wait. That&#39;s not her. That&#39;s a contraction. &lt;em&gt;(Chill out. I&#39;m not in labor. Yet.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My new medical condition</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/06/my-new-medical-condition/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I logged onto my OB&#39;s website today to check out the latest updates to my medical records. I read through a bunch of new test. &lt;em&gt;(All of them are normal.)&lt;/em&gt; And then I discovered that I have been diagnosed with a new medical condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Supervision of elderly primigravida&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what most of those words are, but &amp;quot;primigravida&amp;quot;? WTF is that? According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/primigravida&quot;&gt;Webster&#39;s dictionary&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;primigravida:&lt;/strong&gt; an individual pregnant for the first time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting this all together, I have been diagnosed as an &lt;em&gt;elderly individual&lt;/em&gt; who is pregnant for the first time and needs supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am definitely pregnant and it is definitely my first time. I also definitely need supervision. But... &lt;em&gt;elderly&lt;/em&gt;?!?! Again... WTF? I&#39;m 40, not 400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t mind my while I waddle myself to my next OB appointment with my walker. Kids these days.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>She&#39;s growing... hair</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/06/shes-growing-hair/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At yesterday&#39;s ultrasound, the tech made a comment about my daughter: &amp;quot;She&#39;s growing &lt;em&gt;(pause for dramatic effect)&lt;/em&gt;... hair.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least now I know that she is truly my kid. &lt;em&gt;#arablife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Contractions != Labor</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/06/contractions-labor/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am 33 weeks pregnant as of yesterday, which (naturally?) means contractions start. Seriously. They started. I haven&#39;t had many (maybe a couple a day) and they are not painful, nor are they a sign that I am in labor (yet). But they are normal. And weird. Really, really weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you get closer to your due date, your uterus starts to practice for labor by contracting just a little bit every so often. I suppose it&#39;s like training for a marathon. You know the big day is coming and you start running and training so you know you won&#39;t fall flat on your face from exhaustion when that big day does inevitably comes. Apparently, your uterus has the same idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do appreciate my body making sure it&#39;s ready for this particular big day, contractions are weird! My cousin described hers like menstrual cramps, and that&#39;s close, but I am not sure if it is quite accurate. To me, the contractions feel like my belly is hardening all of a sudden. It stays hard for a little while, and then relaxes itself. They are not painful at all, but they are certainly distracting. (Frankly, my menstrual cramps were &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more painful. But that is another story.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the training has begun. We are T-minus 6 weeks and 6 days. Not that I&#39;m counting. Or excited. Or nervous. Or excited. Or utterly terrified. &lt;em&gt;(You get the point.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advice to older mamas-to-be</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/06/advice-to-older-mamas-to-be/</link>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;A true story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I had an appointment with my high risk doctor for another sonogram. It had been a while since my last sonogram, because all was well way back in February when they last peeked in on the kiddo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walked into my appointment, checked in, and then sat down in the waiting room. Waiting rooms are great times to catch up on my email, Slack messages, texts, Facebook messages, etc. I was doing just that when I received a new email... from my high risk doctor. Well, that&#39;s weird. I&#39;m sitting right here. I mean, I &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; emailed people from across the room before, but that is usually a thing I do with fellow geeks and my doctor doesn&#39;t seem to be that kind of geek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I open the email and discover that they had scheduled a second appointment for me. For the same day. Two hours after the appointment that I was sitting in the waiting room for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to find out that my doctor had somehow &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; realized that I am a 40 year old woman and, as such, I now need to also take something called a &amp;quot;non-stress test&amp;quot;. Like, right now. Because, you know, they had no idea I was 39 the last time I was there and my date of birth isn&#39;t in my chart or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WTF is a &amp;quot;non&amp;quot;-stress test?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what a stress test is. Get on the treadmill, run for a bit, and measure my heart. Frankly, that would have been amazing. &lt;em&gt;(Man, do I miss running!!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A non-stress test is absolutely nothing like that. For starters, mommy has very little to do with it. You sit in a chair with some probes on your belly and the kiddo does all the rest. The test measures her heart rate and activity level over the course of about 20 minutes. She did all the work. I started a new book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sonogram follows, either to peek in on the kiddo or to actually measure all her parts. I did the latter because, as I mentioned before, my last sono was in February and that was a while ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All is well. The kiddo is an overachiever in the heart rate and activity categories. She is also a bit coy and had her head mostly facing my spine. Most of her parts look like random blobs of blobbyness, but all the blobs were appropriately sized and in the right places. We got exactly one shot where my kid looks human. A very cute human. I mean... come on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/ultrasound-week-32.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ultrasound image of the kiddo at week 32&quot; :width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(For those of you who are confused, her head is in the upper left-hand side of the image and she is facing to the right. The pointy nose and pouty lips crack me up!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PSA for the older ladies reading this&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you happen to be a pregnant woman of &amp;quot;advanced maternal age&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you also happen to be turning 40 during your pregnancy, do yourself a favor and tell every doctor you see that you are turning 40 at some point before the baby arrives. Being 40 automatically puts you into a new category of testing that does not exist at 39. This will not prevent you from taking any of the &amp;quot;over 40&amp;quot; tests, nor should it. These tests exist to make sure you and your kiddo are healthy. However, this will prevent you from being &lt;em&gt;surprised&lt;/em&gt; about a test that you all of a sudden &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do that had not planned for in your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors need to respect your time. Mine did not today and lots of words were had about that point. &lt;em&gt;(I mean, me aging should be a surprise to no one.)&lt;/em&gt; A friendly reminder (regardless of how you feel about your age) could hopefully save you some surprise moments. I mean, we get enough of those already. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts about pain</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/05/thoughts-about-pain/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Going into this pregnancy, I always knew the last trimester would be rough. I expected bloating. I expected needing to waddle wherever I go. I expected to hate how my looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, none of that has been the rough part about this last trimester. I am not bloated, for some miraculous reason. I am not exactly waddling. And I wouldn&#39;t classify my feelings about my body as hatred, exactly. I mean, I&#39;m huge, but I&#39;m also not grossed out by myself. &lt;em&gt;(Believe me when I saw that this is a huge step for me.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The roughest part about the last couple of weeks in particular is a feeling of betrayal from my body. I had been doing so well for so long. I was even OK with the slow ramping down of my activity level. I could no longer run 4 miles in 40 minutes, but I could knock out 2 miles in a bit under a half hour. I could not run up the 8 billion stairs in my house, but I could walk up 2 flights and feel pretty reasonable. I signed up for, and therefore expected, this slow down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WTF, body?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then this week happened. I ran &lt;em&gt;(jogged)&lt;/em&gt; on Monday: 1.5 miles in 21 minutes on my treadmill. I felt OK. I went to work... and then the pain started. Not the sciatica I have learned to deal with over the last couple of weeks. I am talking Pain, with a capital P. In my butt. In my pelvis. In my back. It was so bad, I could barely walk, at least not without a lot of shuffling and profanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the kiddo was &lt;em&gt;(and is)&lt;/em&gt; still &lt;em&gt;(very happily)&lt;/em&gt; kicking throughout all of this. I chatted with the doctor and confirmed that she was and is absolutely fine. However, I was not. I made an appointment with a physical therapist and bought a maternity belt &lt;em&gt;(a piece of clothing I did not know existed before 3pm on Monday)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My new reality:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No running. No dancing. No running. No performing for 3 days in a row. No running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you guess which part of this I&#39;m the most upset about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, this is only true for the next 2 months and I suppose I was lucky to have been able to be so active for the first 7+ months of this pregnancy. A lot of soon-to-be moms can&#39;t. But still. Running keeps me sane. So, if you see me crying in a corner, please bring cake. It&#39;s going to be a long 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Wait! Weight?</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/05/wait-weight/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest worries about getting pregnant was the inherent weight gain that comes with it. Yes, I know that sounds really superficial. Yes, I know that I am growing a &lt;em&gt;second human&lt;/em&gt; inside of my body and, of course, she adds to my overall weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;When I was young(er)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had a lot of issues with my body image throughout my entire life. When I was younger, I couldn&#39;t run to the corner without feeling like I was about to die. As a teenager, I would read teen magazines that would say things like &amp;quot;if you can pinch an inch, you need to lose 10 pounds&amp;quot;... and then I would discover that I could pinch &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more than an inch. I would look at my thighs and see them literally double in width when I sat down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what you&#39;re thinking. I should love my body no matter what size or shape it is. And you&#39;re right. But, let&#39;s also face facts here. I was far from the pinnacle of health in my youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is why I stopped eating beef when I was 18. It is why I decided to finally check out the gym when I was 22. It is why started running when I was 24. &lt;em&gt;(Well, there was also this boy... never mind.)&lt;/em&gt; It is why I tried out yoga and practiced for years. It is why I started boxing. It (and the fact that I am super competitive) is why I ran a marathon at 37. &lt;em&gt;(Random aside: The genetics that gave me my family&#39;s knees are why I will never run another marathon.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I became &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; healthier and my body reflected that. I lost a bunch of weight. I gained a bunch of muscle. Yet I was still not 100% happy with how I looked. I am perpetually curvy. And it didn&#39;t help that every so often, before I got pregnant, someone would ask me if I was pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important message to the universe&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not&lt;/strong&gt; ask a woman if she is pregnant &lt;strong&gt;unless you see an actual baby coming out of her.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Flash forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now in my third trimester. I&#39;ve gained weight &lt;em&gt;(obviously)&lt;/em&gt; and I am now officially back &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; to my high school weight. I knew this would happen &lt;em&gt;(again, obviously)&lt;/em&gt; and I look &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; like I did in high school and college. However, it is still a weird and emotional milestone. &lt;em&gt;(Thanks, hormones?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least this time around, I have a good reason to be here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A typical conversation at work</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/05/a-typical-conversation-at-work/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Now that I am quite obviously pregnant, I find that I have more conversations with colleagues that center around my growing belly. This is a conversation that I have with someone at least once per day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(On my way to the restroom.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well meaning colleague:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Standing still.)&lt;/em&gt; Hello! How is the baby doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Stops.)&lt;/em&gt; Fine! In fact, she is doing a drum solo on my bladder right now. &lt;em&gt;(Tries to continue to walk towards the restroom.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WMC:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Still standing still.)&lt;/em&gt; Oh! So you&#39;re having a girl!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Stops again.)&lt;/em&gt; Yes! I am also about to have an accident. Excuse m...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WMC:&lt;/strong&gt; Girls are so great. I have a (girl/boy/cat/cup of coffee).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; Yup. I&#39;m super excited... and uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WMC:&lt;/strong&gt; Fantastic! When are you due?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; In about 30 seconds from now... oh, I mean July 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WMC:&lt;/strong&gt; So soon! That must be exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Me:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Mentally says f-it and runs to the restroom.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love all of you well meaning colleagues, but for the love of all that is good in the world, let the pregnant women in your life pee!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Eating like a hobbit</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/05/eating-like-a-hobbit/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has occurred to me over the last several weeks (months) that a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/105209/what-are-hobbits-daily-eating-schedules&quot;&gt;hobbit&#39;s eating schedule&lt;/a&gt; is also the perfect eating schedule for a pregnant woman, or at least &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; pregnant woman. Allow me to demonstrate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast:&lt;/strong&gt; Around 6am. This tends to be something like a small muffin or bagel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second breakfast:&lt;/strong&gt; Around 9am. This is usually eggs or yogurt... or sometimes both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elevensies:&lt;/strong&gt; Around, well, 11am. This is whatever I happen to have at work that is remotely breakfast-looking, so either fruit, a granola bar, or Cheerios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luncheon:&lt;/strong&gt; Around 1pm. I almost always bring something from home, usually leftovers. My leftovers are usually some combination of meat, beans, and veggies. (When I cook, I throw whatever I have into a crockpot with a bunch of spices and hope for the best.) If I don&#39;t have leftovers, I make PB&amp;amp;J. &lt;em&gt;(Don&#39;t judge me. It&#39;s still delicious.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Afternoon tea:&lt;/strong&gt; Sometime in the afternoon whenever I get hungry again. Since I am still at work, this also tends to be whatever I have at work, so either fruit, peanut butter and crackers, trail mix. Oh, and also tea &lt;em&gt;(of course)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner:&lt;/strong&gt; Around 7 or 8pm. This varies a lot. See my earlier note about my style of cooking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supper:&lt;/strong&gt; Ok, I really don&#39;t eat supper as in the meal you are very likely thinking of right now. But, assuming I&#39;m not already in bed at 9pm, I do eat &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; again because... hungry. This also varies a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>From zero to viable in 24 weeks</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/04/from-zero-to-viable-in-24-weeks/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just had my 24-week appointment today. All is still well! The kiddo has a heartbeat that is high enough. I have blood pressure that is low enough. I am up 9 pounds from my pre-pregnancy weight. At least it&#39;s not 40? &lt;em&gt;(Yet!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also learned today that, as of this week, the kiddo is officially viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wait. What?!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup. It has only been 24 weeks, yet she could theoretically pop out today and be a fully formed human. Not that it&#39;s a good idea for her to do that &lt;em&gt;(so don&#39;t get any ideas, kid!)&lt;/em&gt;, but yikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably shouldn&#39;t be too surprised. I mean, she&#39;s kicking and every so often, she kicks in such a way that I can see something trying to poke out from under my belly. And no, she is not trying to recreate that scene from &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt;. At least, I assume she&#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lost: One belly button</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/04/lost-one-belly-button/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lost:&lt;/strong&gt; One small &amp;quot;innie&amp;quot; belly button. Round and relatively symmetrical. Last seen in the center of my belly, perhaps a week ago. Just looked down today and suddenly it was gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would offer a reward for its return, but I suspect it has run away and is not planning to return until later this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First kick</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/03/first-kick/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She kicked me!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was laying in bed last night &lt;em&gt;(or rather, this morning, since it was after midnight)&lt;/em&gt; and felt a soft, but distinct, kick coming from inside my belly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My kid kicked me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means 3 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She has legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She has leg muscles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Her legs are long enough to reach the inside lining of my belly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, she will be a soccer player. Or a kickboxer. Or a Rockette.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Registry making</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/03/registry-making/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have finally started working on my baby registry. I have been feeling quite a bit of angst about this whole registry-making process for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have never registered for anything in my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have never had a baby, so I need &lt;em&gt;all the things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For every one &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot; that I need, there are (approximately) 86 varieties of that &amp;quot;thing&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where to register?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by sifting through all of the places I could register with, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Target &lt;em&gt;(They do have baby stuff, but don&#39;t exactly scream &amp;quot;baby&amp;quot;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon &lt;em&gt;(Too many choices. Then again, I could register for anything. Does a new tablet count as a baby need?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Babies R Us &lt;em&gt;(Actually a baby store, but aren&#39;t they going out of business?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;buybuy Baby &lt;em&gt;(Definitely a baby store.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with buybuy Baby. Not only are they actually a baby store, but they have a crib that I really like and I am pretty sure they will be around through my delivery. &lt;em&gt;(Again, sorry Babies R Us!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creating the registry&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my registry online, which immediately sent me to a screen asking me to make an appointment with a registry consultant in the store. I had two reactions to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sweet! I get help with this!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oh crap! I&#39;m making a registry for real?!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the appointment, but was pretty nervous about it. As in, the kind of nervousness you feel when you are walking into a test and haven&#39;t even started to study for it. Heck, I don&#39;t even own the book! Am I supposed to already know about all of the kinds of strollers that exist? Or about bottle nipple sizes? Wait a sec. Bottle nipples come in &lt;em&gt;sizes?&lt;/em&gt; I&#39;m so screwed....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a friend agreed to come with me for support. She doesn&#39;t have kids either, but having another human to bounce ideas off of was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-fortunately, the consultant was amazing and took me on a tour of all the baby things. She made recommendations and explained what items are better than others (and in some cases, what a few items are in the first place). This was not a test, but at the end of 90 minutes, I had a good 50-ish item start on my registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Later that day...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I logged onto my registry that evening to tweak a few of the items I put on my registry, adjust some quantities, and generally sanity check the list. Several hours and about 100 more items later, I have a list that is probably still only 75% complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geez, this kid needs a lot of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Current registry status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still reviewing my registry and have asked for help from my family, which consists of actual mothers. I also have a list of things that still need to be added to the registry list, but these items require a bit more research. I am hoping to finish the registry before the kiddo is born.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Officially popped</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/03/officially-popped/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have heard about women &amp;quot;popping&amp;quot;, but I never thought it was a literal description of what happens. I always figured that the process of showing would be pretty gradual, like a sine wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pants are impossible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went from starting to look a little pudgy to &amp;quot;holy cow!.. where did this belly come from?!?&amp;quot; in a matter of days. &lt;em&gt;Days!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happened a week or so ago. Before this point, pants felt a little weird. I stopped being comfortable with my skinny jeans pressing against my belly. Now, nothing fits and I am officially wearing &amp;quot;one size fits all&amp;quot; leggings and real maternity pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oddly more comfortable with myself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My body shape now is more like my (non-pregnant) body shape from high school. I did not like my body in high school. I was pudgy and squishy and very much out of shape. I am much healthier these days. &lt;em&gt;(I can actually run down the block and not feel like I&#39;m having a heart attack.)&lt;/em&gt; However, looking like I did 20 years ago is a little weird. I thought I would get really depressed over it, but I am strangely more comfortable with my body now than I have ever been. Maybe knowing that I actually &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; pregnant (instead of just looking like it) helps.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pregnancy is not for the weak</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/02/pregnancy-is-not-for-the-weak/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to start out this post by saying everything is fine. I am fine. The kiddo is fine. Fine. &lt;em&gt;(Spoiler alert?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Last night...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before I left work yesterday, I discovered that I was bleeding. There was not a whole lot of blood, but it was enough to make me freak out. (Ok, let&#39;s be honest here. &lt;em&gt;Any&lt;/em&gt; amount of blood is enough to make me freak out right now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called my doctor, but, of course, it was after 5:00pm. I was forwarded to the on-call doctor. She did not seem as... let&#39;s say concerned... about this as I was. I was told to call back in the morning, but go see someone if it got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s just say that did not help with my freak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I phoned (well, texted) a friend and the first words out of her mouth (well, fingers) was go to the ER.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about going to my regular hospital, but then I thought about that a little more. It was 5:00pm. In DC. and my regular hospital is near my house. Not in DC. That was going to be a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Off to the ER I go....&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go to the hospital on campus instead, because I could make it there in under 10 minutes, as opposed to the 1 hour-plus it would likely take me to get to my regular hospital. Their ER was amazing. There was none of the stereotypical waiting for a million hours like you hear about all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They immediately took my blood pressure (a little higher than my normal, but still normal) and temperature (always normal). I was taken to a room after 10 minutes or so. I saw a doctor and had both an ultrasound and a pelvic exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both were normal. I got to see the kiddo and her heartbeat was great. The pelvic exam didn&#39;t come up with any blood or weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So... WTF?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctor has no idea where the blood came from, but &lt;em&gt;(good news)&lt;/em&gt;, there hasn&#39;t been any blood since then. He asked for some tests that I will find out the results of in a few days, but the kiddo is not being evicted anytime soon. &lt;em&gt;Phew!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This morning...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called my OB to let them know about everything that happened last night. Long story short, apparently this is normal. They think my placenta was just moving into place and, sometimes, blood happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, fine. Great? But why the $#@#% didn&#39;t the on-call doctor tell me that this was a thing &lt;em&gt;last night?&lt;/em&gt; I mean, I get covering your butts, and I probably would have gone in to see someone either way, but I would also have been a whole lot less panicked.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The girls are out</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/02/the-girls-are-out/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have to say that, so far, my second trimester has been quite pleasant. I finally feel less tired. &lt;em&gt;(Read: I am no longer sleeping 12 hours a day.)&lt;/em&gt; I am definitely not nauseous. I may almost go as far as saying that I feel like my pre-pregnancy self. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still feeling and seeing changes in my body. My skinny pants no longer fit. My big pants are no longer falling down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the obvious belly changes, it is a well known fact that a woman&#39;s breasts grow too. However, this barely-34-B-cup woman was not expecting exactly how this change would pan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grew out of my regular bras pretty a while ago and switched to my stretched out &amp;quot;I have some room in these&amp;quot; bras pretty quickly. In just a matter of weeks, I started popping out of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; bras. And they hurt. And I wanted to rip out their underwires and stab the rest of the bras with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah. I clearly needed new bras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to mall this past weekend to shop. (Those of you who truly know me that just going to the mall period is an act of desperation.) I walked into the (very crowded) store and found someone to size me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, most of you are laughing at me right now. Fair enough. But considering I never thought I would get to a proper C cup, this is insanity to me. And the crazy part is, &lt;em&gt;I&#39;m still growing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: For the first time in my life, I have cleavage. This is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fun with names</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/02/fun-with-names/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since my pregnancy announcement, and especially since my &amp;quot;it&#39;s a girl!&amp;quot; announcement, I have gotten &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of name suggestions. This is despite the fact that I have already decided on the kiddo&#39;s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I decided it would be fun to compile all of these suggestions here for posterity &lt;em&gt;(and future amusement)&lt;/em&gt;. In no particular order, they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Christine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sherifa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nadine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paula Josephine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Josephine Paula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sherifa Josephine Paula&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kimm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Madison&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Candi &lt;em&gt;(or any stripper name)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9 stripper names strung together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alberta&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alberta Jonisdottir&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Albert, Ice Queen of the Rockies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Idina&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elizabeth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeffrey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aspartame &lt;em&gt;(pronounced Ass-par-tah-may)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gertrude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trixie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mildred&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imogene&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bertha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melba&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buttercup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gryselda&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lord Kickass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guacamole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guacamily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tiya&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Felicity Ursula &lt;em&gt;(a.k.a. FU)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mayhem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lightning &lt;em&gt;(because home insurance usually covers incidental damage done by Lightning)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chaos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dragon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crumbelina&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adorabeezle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mayzie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mayzie McMonkey McBean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mahn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wallaby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rudolph&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surprise!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, I have already decided what my daughter&#39;s name will be. But keep the suggestions coming. This is fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Additional updates have been made throughout March, May, and July, 2018.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A hodgepodge of updates</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/01/a-hodgepodge-of-updates/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For &lt;em&gt;(hopefully)&lt;/em&gt; obvious privacy reasons, I originally kept all of my pregnancy posts private, especially while I was still trying to conceive and during my first trimester. In reality, very few people knew about any of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am officially at 13 weeks and firmly in my second trimester, I decided it was time to publish these posts. People I know in person know now. Plus, I really am starting to show now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before publishing, I read through each post &lt;em&gt;(and occasionally edited a few)&lt;/em&gt;. During that process, I realized a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am terrible at blogging in a timely manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because of #1, I forgot to write updates about a few things. I meant to. I just forgot. Because... #1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So.. here are some updates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Donor sperm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ultimately chose to use an anonymous donor. No, there is no book of guys. Yes, there is a database of guys. Yes, you can search by (just about) any attribute. Yes, I have a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of information about this anonymous guy. No, I do not have a photo, because anonymous plus current photo does not work in a world with Google image search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EKG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happened! And I&#39;m normal. As a runner, I was not too surprised, but it&#39;s a pretty required test for women giving birth after age 40. (And, I will be 40 in just a few months. Yay?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Due date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July 31! A Leo baby. Not that I pay too much attention to the zodiac, but someone pointed it out to me and now it&#39;s stuck in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Baby name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I picked out a name. No, I&#39;m not telling you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cravings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. All of them. Except candy. If you know anything about me, you&#39;ll know that is weird.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Over the first (trimester) hurdle</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2018/01/over-the-first-trimester-hurdle/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will be 13 weeks pregnant tomorrow. This is huge because it means, not only am I super officially out of my first trimester, but I am also at a point where I have been getting a lot of test results back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The 12 week checkup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had my 12 week checkup with my OB late last week. No sonogram but the doctor did pull out a tiny little machine from his pocket to check the baby&#39;s heartbeat. The kiddo&#39;s heart sounds fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All the genetic testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I am &amp;quot;old&amp;quot;, I had a couple of genetic screenings done. The first was a blood test that tests for a long list of genetic conditions, including Trisomy 21 (Downs Syndrome) and Trisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome). It is also a very accurate test for the baby&#39;s sex. In this test, they take a million &lt;em&gt;(well, four)&lt;/em&gt; vials of blood and tell you that results won&#39;t come in for fourteen business days. That&#39;s great news to hear just before a holiday weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I got the results &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; earlier than anticipated. &lt;strong&gt;Everything is normal!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also... &lt;strong&gt;it&#39;s a girl!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(No, I am not doing a gender reveal party. Obviously. I&#39;m just announcing this to everyone via email, blog post, group text, random shouting, and carrier pigeon.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second genetic test happened today and included a very extensive ultrasound, where I got to see my baby from literally every angle. I even got to see her bladder. Twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the coolest thing ever. (I am not just talking about her bladder.) She looks like a fully formed human! I got to see her head, nose, hands, feet, knees... just about everything. So. Amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/ultrasound-week-13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ultrasound image of the kiddo at week 13&quot; :width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More good news: &lt;strong&gt;Everything is still normal!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Chatting with the high risk doctor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am over 35 &lt;em&gt;(and especially since I will be 40 when I deliver)&lt;/em&gt;, I now have a high risk doctor. I met him after today&#39;s test. He is great and very data-focused &lt;em&gt;(an attribute I really appreciate)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I thought I was living at my doctor&#39;s office before, I will &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; be living there once I am at 32 weeks. I will need to go back for weekly screenings to check on the kiddo&#39;s development. Depending on how she&#39;s doing, there is a chance I may be forced to deliver early -- even as early as 37 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, so far, so good!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>So many questions</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/12/so-many-questions/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I begin to tell more and more people about my pregnancy as a single mother-to-be, I have gotten a lot of questions. So many, that I decided to keep a list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;re not waiting until you find a husband?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why don&#39;t you want to get married?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you gay?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait, you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don&#39;t want to get married?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are you feeling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your doctor wants you to eat &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; often? Isn&#39;t she worried about you gaining weight?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you having twins?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; it&#39;s not twins?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seriously, you&#39;re not having twins, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know this is hard, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Like, really, really hard?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you even think about this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was expecting both positive and negative reactions (and questions). To be honest, I wasn&#39;t expecting mean, but, well, mean people don&#39;t really belong in my life anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind you, I&#39;m not answering any of these questions here. This is a list of questions, not answers. &lt;em&gt;(However, I will say that ice cream is on the list of recommended foods for nausea from my doctor.)&lt;/em&gt; If you want answers, feel free to find me in the wild and ask in person. Or, in the case of some of these questions, don&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I live in doctors&#39; offices now</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/12/i-live-in-doctors-offices-now/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am now 8 weeks pregnant and just had my first OB appointment today. Everything went smoothly. Pap smear... check! Breast exam... check! Consult with my OB... check! Five vials of blood taken for &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; the tests... check!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned today that I am officially high risk, or, as all of the doctors and nurses like to say, at an &amp;quot;advanced maternal age&amp;quot;. I&#39;m going to get out my walker now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that really means that I need to have roughly 523 more appointments and tests before the end of my first trimester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Genetic screening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of my &amp;quot;high risk&amp;quot; status, genetic screening is medically necessary, to test for things like Downs Syndrome and Trisomy 18. There are 2 different tests that I can take: one at 10 weeks that tests for those conditions plus a host of other things and one at 12-14 weeks that tests for those conditions plus looks at an ultrasound of the kiddo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, both are covered by my insurance because of my &amp;quot;advanced maternal age.&amp;quot; Age has its perks, kids!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heart screening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also need to have an EKG because of &lt;em&gt;(you guessed it)&lt;/em&gt; my &amp;quot;advanced maternal age.&amp;quot; This I need schedule as soon as possible, so the doctors know if I have any heart conditions that might come into play during delivery. I am a runner (and yes, I am still running, with the doctor&#39;s OK for now), so hopefully all will be well here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The rest of the kitchen sink&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also need a glucose test and something called a &amp;quot;24 hour urine test&amp;quot;, which I am really hoping does not involve me peeing for 24 hours straight. &lt;em&gt;(Spoiler: It probably does not.)&lt;/em&gt; But those tests don&#39;t happen for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The accessibility of ::before and ::after</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/12/before-after-accessibility/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently reading a tutorial on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pineco.de/using-css-counters/&quot;&gt;how to use CSS counters&lt;/a&gt;. They look great! CSS counters are a new feature of CSS that allow us as developers to enumerate elements in the DOM and then do something with that information. There are plenty of practical uses for this -- from numbering highlighted blocks in the text to creating complex nested ordered list bullets. &lt;em&gt;(I mean, we&#39;ve all read government documents that include bullet point 13.2.4.1.  Right?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these implementations involve using the &lt;code&gt;::before&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;::after&lt;/code&gt; CSS pseudo-selectors in order to display the counter information on the page, before a particular block. With all of my work with accessibility this year, it begged the question: &lt;em&gt;Is CSS-generated content accessible?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Is this even supported?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should probably start with asking, are CSS counters universally supported by browsers. The answer is yes. Really, with 98.16% support according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/css-counters&quot;&gt;CanIUse.com&lt;/a&gt;, this is barely a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alrighty then. What about screen readers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screen readers are another story and one that, frankly, I was skeptical about. I did a bit of Google research and came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://tink.uk/accessibility-support-for-css-generated-content/&quot;&gt;an article that showed mixed results&lt;/a&gt; in terms of whether the readers read this generated content. The biggest offender was in IE, where neither JAWS nor NVDA read the content.  This is presumably because the content does not reside in the DOM and these readers are reading the DOM, as opposed to the visible content on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because this article is almost 3 years old, I decided to conduct my own experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created a simple example to use in testing that included content using both the &lt;code&gt;::before&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;::after&lt;/code&gt; selectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested in as many screen readers and browsers that I have access to. I have access to two operating systems (Mac OS X and Windows 10) and three screen readers (VoiceOver, JAWS, and NVDA). I used the latest versions of all browsers tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Testing hurdles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across a couple of issues that made testing... adventurous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why I did not test in Firefox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried! Firefox does not play well with screen readers. At all. When the browser sees that you are using a screen reader, it disables the the display of tab content because of &amp;quot;incompatibility&amp;quot;. This incompatibility appears to be universally true since I had this issue with every screen reader on both my Mac and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/firefox-tab-content-dialog.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Firefox dialog stating &#39;Display of tab content is disabled due to incompatibility between Firefox and your accessibility software. Please update your screen reader or switch to Firefox Extended Support Release.&#39;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;A very &quot;helpful&quot; Firefox dialog that pops up when you are running accessibility software.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;solution&amp;quot; is to download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/enterprise/&quot;&gt;Firefox Extended Support browser&lt;/a&gt;. Because, you know, making your base browser compatible with accessibility software is too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except, that did not work. Even with the Extended Support version of the browser, both NVDA and JAWS refused to read anything on any web page. (I did not try to install this on my Mac because now I&#39;m really angry at Mozilla.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;JAWS and Edge&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAWS does not support Microsoft Edge by default. Actually, any sort of Edge support in JAWS is relatively new, as it was introduced in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blindbargains.com/bargains.php?m=17801&quot;&gt;JAWS 18.0.4321 release&lt;/a&gt; in September 2017. In order to get JAWS to read content in Edge, you must both have a recent version of JAWS (always a good idea anyway) and turn the Edge browser support feature on in the Settings Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific results of my testing are in the table below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;|  | Chrome  | Safari | Edge | Internet Explorer 11
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| VoiceOver | Yes! | Yes! | -- | -- |
| JAWS | Yes! | -- | Yes! | No |
| NVDA | Yes! | -- | Yes! | No |&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that all screen readers read the CSS generated content in Chrome, Safari, and Microsoft Edge. That is actually great news, since these 3 browsers combined account for over 73% of the global browser market share in November 2017 according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php?year=2017&amp;amp;month=11&quot;&gt;W3Counter Stats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the bad news is that no screen reader was able to read the CSS generated content in Internet Explorer 11. (The study linked above from 2 years ago found the same results.) While IE 11 only accounts for 3.33% of the global market share (again, for November 2017), 3.33% of the &lt;em&gt;entire world&lt;/em&gt; accounts to a fair amount of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can very likely use CSS generated content without worrying too much about accessibility concerns. I don&#39;t want to give you a full pass since, in addition to your IE 11 users &lt;em&gt;(just upgrade to Edge already!)&lt;/em&gt;, I did not even try to test on real mobile devices. However it did seem to work when I emulated mobile devices in Chrome using dev tools and tested with VoiceOver as a &amp;quot;quickie&amp;quot; test.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;m a Time Lord!</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/12/im-a-time-lord/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am 7 weeks pregnant today. Ultrasound #2 happened this morning. I was particularly nervous about this one because I have literally felt nothing for the past week. I mean, my breasts hurt and I&#39;m dizzy about 50% of the time, but there has been zero morning sickness. I&#39;m pregnant. I should be throwing up! (Wait a sec. Am I seriously complaining about &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; throwing up?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was all good news. My kid exists! And it has a heartbeat! There are two hearts inside me right now. You all know what that means. &lt;strong&gt;I am a Time Lord!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, today was a big deal because it means that I have officially &amp;quot;graduated&amp;quot; from my fertility clinic. I can still see them for another couple of weeks (until week 10), so the &amp;quot;break up&amp;quot; can be gradual. My first OB appointment is next week. I chose to use my gynecologist as my OB because, frankly, she&#39;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ultrasound research</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/12/ultrasound-research/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It occurred to me over the weekend that insurance in this country is kind of dumb and, as a result, a limited number of ultrasounds are likely covered under my insurance plan. So this week I decided to do some research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From my insurance provider&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted my insurance company first. In reply, I received a very confusing message that included a lot of legalese (which I am still waiting for my provider to translate into English). However, that message also included the fact that only &lt;strong&gt;one ultrasound per pregnancy&lt;/strong&gt; is covered by my plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously? &lt;em&gt;One?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already had one ultrasound to confirm the fact that I&#39;m pregnant in the first place? Does this mean I am screwed for the remaining 8 months of my pregnancy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They did add a provision that other ultrasounds may be covered if they are deemed medically necessary, but they did not define &amp;quot;medically necessary&amp;quot;. I&#39;m hoping that includes the fact that I will be 40 (!!) when this kid is born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am waiting for clarification on all of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From my fertility clinic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I contacted my nurse and the financial office at my fertility clinic in the hopes that they could help me translate the insurance company&#39;s reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the up side, they speak &amp;quot;normal average human&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the down side, they could not provide more details about what the insurance company was trying to say either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the up side, they were able to give me real numbers about how much an ultrasound costs. $295. &lt;em&gt;(In my case. YMMV.)&lt;/em&gt; That&#39;s not terrible. I mean, it&#39;s less than half the cost of sperm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First picture!</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/11/first-picture/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went in for my first OB ultrasound this morning. Remember everything I said about weirdness coming out of me in my last post? It&#39;s fine. All of that is &lt;em&gt;(apparently)&lt;/em&gt; normal. #thingsTheyDontShareAboutBeingPregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my dream of starting a football team comprised entirely of same-age siblings has been dashed. I am only growing one kiddo, who, to be honest, currently looks like a little blob inside a slightly bigger blob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kiddo/blob is healthy and a good size. Woohoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/ultrasound-week-5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ultrasound image of the kiddo at week 5&quot; :width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week 5 confusion</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/11/week-5-confusion/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started a new bottle of progesterone today. For those of you just tuning in, that&#39;s the one that I stick up my vagina twice a day. It makes me bleed for about an hour each time -- only a little and that is apparently OK. Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention this new bottle because today is my first day on progesterone where I did not bleed. I will spare you all what actually happened, but after speaking with my nurse, the &amp;quot;new thing&amp;quot; that happened is apparently normal and expected. Then I told her about the bleeding from before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three words you never want to hear from a medical professional: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Huh. That&#39;s weird.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Umm...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I told my original nurse about the bleeding when it started 2 weeks ago, just after my IUI. &lt;em&gt;(I now have a new nurse for reasons unknown.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original nurse said the original bleeding was normal and expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New nurse said the &amp;quot;new thing&amp;quot; is normal and expected. She is currently checking to see what&#39;s up with the original bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I googled my symptoms... don&#39;t judge me.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can tell from the internet, both bleeding and &amp;quot;new thing&amp;quot; are normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, as far as I can tell, nothing is normal when it comes to my body this week.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has met me in person, you may have noticed something missing between my neck and abdomen. I can assure you that my body has now rectified that situation. Quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beta pregnancy tests are a thing</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/11/beta-pregnancy-tests-are-a-thing/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After learning I was pregnant, I went home for Thanksgiving &lt;em&gt;(as one does?)&lt;/em&gt; and spent 4 days dodging questions about why I wasn&#39;t drinking and why I would chase squirrels any time someone lit up a cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&#39;s besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I got home, I went in for my beta pregnancy test. That is the pregnancy test you get after your pregnancy test to make sure you&#39;re still pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I am super pregnant.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test measures HCG, which is basically your pregnancy hormone. My HCG at my original pregnancy test was 300-something-or-other. This number is supposed to double or triple for the beta test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My beta test result was over 4000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup. That&#39;s more than double. In fact, it&#39;s more than 11 times as much as my original test. This can only mean one thing....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I&#39;m growing my own football team.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch out Patriots. You&#39;re going to have some competition... eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, the giant leap in numbers could mean anything, from &amp;quot;I&#39;m definitely pregnant&amp;quot; to, seriously, there&#39;s more than one kiddo in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first OB ultrasound is later this week. I&#39;ll know more then.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Holy cow... I&#39;m pregnant!!</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/11/holy-cow-im-pregnant/</link>
      <description>&lt;h2&gt;I&#39;m pregnant!!!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found out 3 days ago, but could not figure out how to write until today. I am so many emotions all at once: Shocked. Excited. Terrified. Excited. Nauseous. Dizzy. Back to terrified. And circling back to excited again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few more &amp;quot;beta&amp;quot; pregnancy tests and initial ultrasounds that I have to pass to &amp;quot;graduate&amp;quot; from the fertility clinic to my OB. But...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&#39;m pregnant!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It hasn&#39;t even been 2 weeks!</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/11/it-hasnt-even-been-2-weeks/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, at 13 dpiui, marks the day before my pregnancy test. I feel nauseous. And dizzy. And I may have my period. Or maybe that&#39;s just all the bleeding from the progesterone. Which could explain the dizziness. Or not. How the hell should I know?! Oh, did I mention I&#39;m cranky? And hungry. Oh crap. I forgot that I&#39;m nauseous.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IUI #4: The final frontier?</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/11/iui-4-the-final-frontier/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a little bit behind in my blogging here, but I had my 4th IUI last Tuesday, which means as of today, I am 6 dpiui.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Medication update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am on progesterone, which if you were paying attention to my previous post about medications, is that pill you take vaginally. &lt;em&gt;(Again... ugh.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to report that the pill-taking process is going well, in that I am successfully taking the meds. Funny thing about progesterone: it makes you bleed. This is a common and very expected side effect. This is also not a side effect I am thrilled with. My nurse told me that a panty liner will be sufficient for the bleeding. It is not. While I am not bleeding a ton &lt;em&gt;(it is certainly not enough to fill an entire maxi pad)&lt;/em&gt;, I am definitely -- and regularly -- bleeding enough where a liner is not going to cover it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about the bleeding is that it starts almost immediately and it is over in under an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symptom update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that the reason why I forgot about posting here for a while is because I have been feeling no symptoms. Well... minimal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My symptoms are so minimal that I am not sure if they are symptoms at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two nights ago, I was eating a turkey dinner in a mason jar, complete with potatoes, gravy, and cranberry sauce. I love all of these things; however this combination was surprisingly disgusting. I can chalk that up to the recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a weird ache in my lower abdomen. No idea what that&#39;s about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I feel almost (but not quite) nauseous every so often. No actual nausea. Most of the time it&#39;s gas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are these real symptoms or am I subconsciously working myself up? We&#39;ll find out soon, I suppose!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cycle monitoring update</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/11/cycle-monitoring-update/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been slacking on my updates. &lt;em&gt;(I did warn you all about my blogging infrequency.)&lt;/em&gt; Today is day 9 of my cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in for a monitoring session last week on day 3. These monitoring sessions include a blood test and an ultrasound, to check out my ovaries. Everything looked great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in for a second monitoring session today. Today&#39;s session was important because I could be potentially close to ovulating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not, but I am on track. My estrogen levels from my blood work look good. I have a bunch of follicles. Three of them are on the larger side: 10-11mm. They need to get to at least 18mm before I can take the Ovidrel (the &amp;quot;trigger shot&amp;quot;) and schedule the IUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am pretty close, I have another monitoring session in two days (day 11 of my cycle). Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Medication: A reality story</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/10/medication-a-reality-story/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is day 1 of my new cycle. I am back from vacation and ready to start trying again. It seems like a good time to figure out what all of my new medication does, right? Sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap: I need to be on three different medications: Clomid, Ovidrel, and Prometrium. These medications are all taken at different, specific times during my cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s break this down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Clomid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will take Clomid orally on days 3 through 7 of my cycle. Clomid is used to stimulate the production of follicles in my ovaries so I produce more eggs. Egg production is not exactly my problem, but my doctor wants to use this to speed things along since my last three pregnancy attempts were all busts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am on the lowest dose possible (25mg) to give my system a boost, while minimizing my chances of having multiples. This is a huge concern. More Clomid equals more follicle stimulation, which equals more eggs, which equals more chances of more babies. Terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This super low dose equates to half a pill. Yes, half. I already purchased a pill splitter, which I now know exists, so that I can split &lt;em&gt;the world&#39;s smallest pill&lt;/em&gt; in half. That should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ovidrel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ovidrel is also known as the &amp;quot;trigger shot&amp;quot;. It is literally an injection. With a needle. And a sharps disposal bin. Because &lt;strong&gt;needle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will stab myself with this needle -- I mean, give myself this injection -- when my doctor determines that my follicles are big enough for me to start ovulating. This medication literally stimulates the ovulation and makes sure it happens (hence the name &amp;quot;trigger shot&amp;quot;). This will probably happen close to day 10, but my doctor will be monitoring me and lets me know when to officially take this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prometrium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prometrium (also called progesterone) is used to regulate my cycle after I have the IUI. I need to take this one twice a day vaginally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait a second.... Vaginally? &lt;em&gt;Are you f----ing kidding me?! Oh h--- no!! I know I swore about this in my last post... still swearing!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even asked my nurse about this. I am supposed to insert these giant gel pills inside my vagina &lt;em&gt;as far as I can get them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then what? They dissolve? They swim up my uterus? They sit there and block traffic? My nurse said that they won&#39;t fall out, but seriously, how does she know? She hasn&#39;t met my vagina. (Really, she hasn&#39;t. She&#39;s an email-only nurse.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... yeah. Vagina, meet pills. Pills, meet vagina. I hope they like each other.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Screen reader survey results</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/10/screen-reader-survey-results/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I launched a survey to help me answer some lingering questions I have had about what tools screen reader users user to navigate websites.  Specifically, I wanted to learn about how users interact with links on a site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is this survey all about?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question of screen reader user interaction stemmed from the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/08/unique-link-text-is-important&quot;&gt;unique link text&lt;/a&gt; is an important aspect of an accessible website. Among many other reasons, one rationale that I have come across for unique link text is the fact that screen reader users can navigate a page via an alphabetical list of all links.  However, the &lt;em&gt;(very few)&lt;/em&gt; screen reader users I know do not alphabetize that list.  I wanted to see if this links list is widely used and &lt;em&gt;(sadly)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey6/&quot;&gt;WebAIM&#39;s screen reader survey&lt;/a&gt; does not contain this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I created my own &lt;em&gt;(very short)&lt;/em&gt; screen reader survey. The goal is to get a clearer picture around how screen reader users use the navigation features of their readers.  The survey focuses on the links list, the landmarks list, and the headings list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Survey basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey consisted of 8 questions.  I asked respondents about how often they use a screen reader, which one(s) they use, and if they have ever used the reader&#39;s landmarks list, headings list, or links list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I collected responses from August 15, 2017, through September 13, 2017 and received 42 total responses. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XTV2PSD&quot;&gt;The survey is still open&lt;/a&gt;; however I have not received any responses since September 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;m-top&quot;&gt;How often do you use a screen reader to navigate a website?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 42 respondents to this survey, 35 of them use a screen reader at least some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;m-top&quot;&gt;How long have you been using a screen reader?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the 35 respondents who use a screen reader at least some of the time can arguably be considered expert users. Over 68% of the respondents (24 users of 35) have been using screen readers for over 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;m-top&quot;&gt;Which screen reader do you use?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, of the 35 users, most use either JAWS or VoiceOver. Respondents were able to select more than one screen reader, since many will use multiple readers depending on their situations and preferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Landmarks list usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landmarks list appears to have very mixed results.  Only about 50% of respondents who use a screen reader (18 users of 35) reported that they use the landmarks list at least some of the time.  The other 50% (17 users of 35) reported that they either never use this list or had no idea this feature existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Headings list usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the headings list appears to be used quite frequently among respondents.  Over 77% of respondents who use a screen reader reported that they use the headings list at least some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions of whether of how screen reader users use the links list was the catalyst for this survey.  Like the headings list, a clear majority of over 77% of users (or 27 users of 35) reported that use the links list at least some of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;m-top&quot;&gt;Do you ever use the screen reader&#39;s links list?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;svg width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;240&quot;&gt;&lt;desc&gt;

&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data for All the time&lt;/title&gt;&lt;desc&gt;The number of All the time is 15, which is 100% of the total.&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;rect height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; x=&quot;120&quot; y=&quot;-7&quot; fill=&quot;#1fa510&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; y=&quot;20&quot; fill=&quot;black&quot;&gt;All the time&lt;/text&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;128&quot; y=&quot;20&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;15&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data for Most of the time&lt;/title&gt;&lt;desc&gt;The number of Most of the time is 3, which is 20% of the total.&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;rect height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;20%&quot; x=&quot;120&quot; y=&quot;41&quot; fill=&quot;#097c47&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; y=&quot;68&quot; fill=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Most of the time&lt;/text&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;128&quot; y=&quot;68&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;3&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data for Sometimes&lt;/title&gt;&lt;desc&gt;The number of Sometimes is 9, which is 60% of the total.&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;rect height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;60%&quot; x=&quot;120&quot; y=&quot;89&quot; fill=&quot;#247a00&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; y=&quot;116&quot; fill=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Sometimes&lt;/text&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;128&quot; y=&quot;116&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;9&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data for Never&lt;/title&gt;&lt;desc&gt;The number of Never is 3, which is 20% of the total.&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;rect height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;20%&quot; x=&quot;120&quot; y=&quot;137&quot; fill=&quot;#1e8e05&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; y=&quot;164&quot; fill=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Never&lt;/text&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;128&quot; y=&quot;164&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;3&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data for This exists?&lt;/title&gt;&lt;desc&gt;The number of This exists? is 4, which is 26.666666666666668% of the total.&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;rect height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;26.666666666666668%&quot; x=&quot;120&quot; y=&quot;185&quot; fill=&quot;#6a9b01&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; y=&quot;212&quot; fill=&quot;black&quot;&gt;This exists?&lt;/text&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;128&quot; y=&quot;212&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;4&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class=&quot;m-top&quot;&gt;If you use the links list, how do you sort the links?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 27 users who use the links list at least some of the time, an overwhelming majority of 89% (24 users of 27) view the list in DOM order. I am counting both the users who responded that they have no idea about the order as users who view the list in DOM order because these users are likely using the default settings.  The default settings for the links list is DOM order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;svg width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;144&quot;&gt;&lt;desc&gt;
If you use the links list, how do you sort the links?
&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data for DOM order&lt;/title&gt;&lt;desc&gt;The number of DOM order is 20, which is 100% of the total.&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;rect height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; x=&quot;120&quot; y=&quot;-7&quot; fill=&quot;#3b8906&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; y=&quot;20&quot; fill=&quot;black&quot;&gt;DOM order&lt;/text&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;128&quot; y=&quot;20&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;20&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data for Alphabetically&lt;/title&gt;&lt;desc&gt;The number of Alphabetically is 3, which is 15% of the total.&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;rect height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;15%&quot; x=&quot;120&quot; y=&quot;41&quot; fill=&quot;#009661&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; y=&quot;68&quot; fill=&quot;black&quot;&gt;Alphabetically&lt;/text&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;128&quot; y=&quot;68&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;3&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data for No idea&lt;/title&gt;&lt;desc&gt;The number of No idea is 4, which is 20% of the total.&lt;/desc&gt;&lt;rect height=&quot;40&quot; width=&quot;20%&quot; x=&quot;120&quot; y=&quot;89&quot; fill=&quot;#0f962a&quot;&gt;&lt;/rect&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; y=&quot;116&quot; fill=&quot;black&quot;&gt;No idea&lt;/text&gt;&lt;text height=&quot;40&quot; x=&quot;128&quot; y=&quot;116&quot; fill=&quot;white&quot;&gt;4&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/g&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, 42 respondents is not a large enough sample set to draw any hard conclusions.  However, I learned quite a few things and reaffirmed some assumptions I had going into this survey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority of screen reader users are very experienced in using screen readers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen reader users are using the navigation tools provided by readers, such as the landmarks, headings, and links lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While the vast majority of users view the links list in DOM order, there are a few who choose to alphabetize this list. (This also means that the option to alphabetize links really does exist!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>A complicated story about medication and logistics</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/10/medication-and-logistics/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am starting to prep for my next attempt. This one will be medicated, which is terrifying in and of itself. I will be on I&#39;ll be on Clomid &lt;em&gt;(a pill taken orally)&lt;/em&gt;, Prometrium &lt;em&gt;(a pill taken vaginally, which should be interesting)&lt;/em&gt;, and Ovedril &lt;em&gt;(a syringe and I just don&#39;t want to know yet)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finding a pharmacy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My insurance covers none of this, so my doctor called in the prescription to a couple of online pharmacies so that I can compare prices. Freedom Fertility came back with the best price, so I called them back a couple days later to place the order. On that second call, I was told that they got the total wrong when they quoted me during the first call. The total price they quoted was actually for only 2 of the 3 meds I need. (This is after I asked them the first time if that was for all 3, because it was so much lower.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I feel that quotes should be mathematically accurate, I asked to speak with a supervisor. She said that she would review the tape of that first conversation and see if she could do anything for me price-wise. She was supposed to call me back the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days later, I had not heard from her, so I called her back to follow up. This turned into two days of phone tag. When I finally got that supervisor on the phone, she agreed that the quote from the original call was stated wrong. However, she could not actually do anything for me to honor that original &amp;quot;quote&amp;quot;, or even meet me half way between that &amp;quot;quote&amp;quot; and the real price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire process of calling and waiting for answers wasted about a week. Thankfully, I do not need the meds until October, but that is not the point. The point is I expected this pharmacy to be professional. That professionalism includes accuracy in the quotes given and owning up to their mistakes. Since that clearly was not going to happen, I informed the Freedom Fertility supervisor that I could not do business with them, regardless of price. If I can&#39;t trust you to give me an accurate price when I ask for it, I am certainly not going to trust you with medications that I have to put in my body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hmm... next!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called my doctor back to ask if there were any other pharmacies I could work with, since the prices of the other original pharmacies were still much higher than Freedom Fertility&#39;s price, even after learning the real total cost. Luckily, she was able to call it into another pharmacy: Cornerstone Pharmacy. Their quote for all 3 medications was cheaper than Freedom Fertility&#39;s inaccurate quote (for just 2 of the meds). Sold!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this was the lowest quote I&#39;ve gotten to date, I jumped on this. I received the medications the other day and confirmed that they are all correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of getting medication was way crazier than it should have been. At least it had a happy ending. Buyer beware.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hiatus</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/08/hiatus/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, IUI attempt #3 was a bust. I am heartbroken, not just because this failed, but because I honestly thought it was going well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I had symptoms.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am even pretty sure they were not psychosomatic. There were days when I felt nauseous after eating. Right before AF reared her ugly head, my breasts hurt. I mean, they &lt;em&gt;hurt&lt;/em&gt;. That is saying a lot, since in my particular case, there isn&#39;t much there &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; hurt. Even when AF did come, it was different. The first day and a half were very slow, which is not even close to my normal. You could almost say I was more spotting than anything. I honestly thought it was implantation bleeding, at least until it went to full flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, my body duped me. I&#39;m sure it was all hormones and stress. I have spent the last 3 months strategically putting foreign material into my body. My systems are understandably freaking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, what&#39;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am taking a break. I am going overseas on vacation in two months. The thought of trying again with my next (pre-vacation) cycle did occur to me. However my friends, nurse, and random not-exactly-strangers in my online support group all agree that I should wait until after my trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectually, I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotionally, I feel like a two-month wait means that I will lose momentum, despite the fact that momentum is not a real thing here. However, I have been feeling more symptoms with each attempt. Maybe that means I am getting closer with each try? Also, I am almost 40. Assuming I get pregnant at some point, I will definitely be over 40 when this kid is born. That number bothers me more and more with each passing month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intellect wins the day.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of my emotions -- or because of them -- I need the break. These past 3 months have been emotionally exhausting. It&#39;s like going for an audition, thinking you nailed it, and then getting a letter in &lt;strong&gt;giant red letters&lt;/strong&gt; that says you have been rejected... and then repeating the process over and over again. Just typing that last sentence was exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;One last thing (for now):&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received my new protocol for attempt #4. While my last 3 attempts have been with my natural cycle, attempt #4 will feature &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the drugs. Well, not really &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them. But I will be on 3 different medications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clomid:&lt;/strong&gt; At least that one is oral. It stimulates egg production. I will be on a very low dose, which still increases my chances for multiples. I don&#39;t pray, but I am also a one-at-a-time kind of girl, so I may start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ovidrel:&lt;/strong&gt; The trigger shot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prometrium:&lt;/strong&gt; A capsule I have to take vaginally. &lt;em&gt;Vaginally&lt;/em&gt; How the f#%$ do you take a pill vaginally?!? I mean, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible, otherwise my doctor would not prescribe that, but... wtf?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you all in 2 months. If I were you, I would expect a lot more swearing and use of the word &amp;quot;vaginally&amp;quot; here when I come back.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Yes, Virginia. Unique link text really is important.</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/08/unique-link-text-is-important/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest pet peeves these days stems around blog or news sites. Your typical blog front page will include a bunch of articles.  Each article has a title, a date, maybe an image, and a small bit of &amp;quot;teaser&amp;quot; text from the article itself.  The goal is to get the reader to choose a specific article and click to read the entire article.  To make that goal abundantly clear, each article on this front page includes a link or a button that usually says &amp;quot;Read More&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;(or something similar)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sigh.&lt;/em&gt;  &amp;quot;Read More.&amp;quot;  In context, this link makes sense.  If we have a page that includes an article blurb about cats and an article blurb about dogs, I can click on the &amp;quot;Read More&amp;quot; link next to the cat article to read more about cats or the &amp;quot;Read More&amp;quot; link next to the dog article to read more about dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But what if I can&#39;t see the page?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s say that instead of looking at the page, I am reading the page using a screen reader.  I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; read the content on the page sequentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I can also pull up a list of all of the links on the page and figure out where I want to navigate to next based on this links list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The links list is content out of context.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of this links list is the entire basis of my &amp;quot;Read More&amp;quot; pet peeve.  All of these &amp;quot;Read More&amp;quot; links are now a problem because they have redundant link text, but they go to different locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is enough context on the page itself to establish which &amp;quot;Read More&amp;quot; link belongs to which article, that context only exists when a user is looking at the page layout or reading the content of the page sequentially.  The links by themselves do not provide this context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s check out an example from the Evernote blog:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/evernote-links-list.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The links list for the Evernote blog from VoiceOver&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just part of the links list, but we can already see that there are three different &amp;quot;READ MORE&amp;quot; links.  Read more what?  Am I reading more of the same article a bunch of times?  Probably not.  In that case, which of these &amp;quot;Read More&amp;quot; links go to which article?  Without the context of the page, there is no way to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How is this links list generated?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every screen reader generates a links list from all of the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags in the HTML for the page.  The links list shows these links in order and, by default, labels them according to their link text.  So, for example, if the HTML looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My first article&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/article1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Read More&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My second article&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/article2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Read More&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My third article&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/article3&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Read More&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the screen reader&#39;s links list will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Read More
Read More
Read More
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helpful, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A better links list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, I can add the &lt;code&gt;aria-label&lt;/code&gt; attribute to these links to give screen readers more specific information about each link.  So, the previous example can be fixed like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My first article&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/article1&amp;quot; aria-label=&amp;quot;Read more about my first article&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Read More&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My second article&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/article2&amp;quot; aria-label=&amp;quot;Read more about my second article&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Read More&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;My third article&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;/article3&amp;quot; aria-label=&amp;quot;Read more about my third article&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Read More&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the new and improved links list will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Read more about my first article
Read more about my second article
Read more about my third article
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Need more information?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to read more about the WCAG requirements around unique link text, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-link.html&quot;&gt;WCAG Success Criterion 2.4.9&lt;/a&gt; addresses this in more detail.  This particular issue is a AAA issue; however it is still an important one to address for screen reader users.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Testing your websites to ensure they are fully accessible is a lot of work.  There are a bunch of tools out there to help you thoroughly test your sites -- &lt;a href=&quot;https://siteimprove.com/&quot;&gt;Siteimprove&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://tenon.io/&quot;&gt;Tenon&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These automated tools do an excellent job at catching issues that are straightforward and programmatic.  However, they are not an end-all-be-all solution to accessibility testing.  Your users, regardless of their abilities or needs, are ultimately human beings. Therefore, part of your testing routine needs to involve humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes... I am suggesting you do more work.  However, trust me.  It&#39;s worth it.  At the end of the day, you will catch issues that an algorithm cannot, and your websites will be that much better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a bunch of tips that my team and I use at work to test our sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keyboard navigability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as you load a page, start tabbing through the elements on the page and test for the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tab order&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; You can tab through items from left to right, top to bottom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tab ability&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; You should be able to tab through the entire page, without getting stuck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus outline&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; All focused items are outlined and the outline is obviously visible (i.e. the outline should contrast well with the background).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focused element&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; The focused item should be visible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip links&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; Skip links exist and are visible when they have focus.  Usually, skip links will be the first tabbable element on the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Off-canvas navigation&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; If there is an off-canvas navigation panel, you should be able to open the navigation, tab through the links inside of it, and close the navigation all with the keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hover navigation (i.e. mega menus)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; If there are navigation menus that a mouse user would see on hover, then you should be able to see the navigation by pressing the down arrow, tab through the links inside of that panel, and exit the navigation by pressing the up arrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Screen reader readability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turn on your screen reader of choice.  Have the reader read through the page sequentially and test for the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All content is read&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; The screen reader should not get stuck at any point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden content is not read&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; For example, the off-canvas navigation or a hidden search form should only be read by the screen reader when that element is actually visible on the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The content that is read makes sense&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; The biggest issues here are things like phone numbers, dates, abbreviations in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Landmarks... the screen reader test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull up the list of landmarks in your screen reader and test for the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landmarks exist&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; All content on the page must be inside of a landmark container.  Therefore, unless there is nothing on the page, at least one landmark must exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing landmarks have roles that make sense for their content&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; For example, a sidebar should have a complementary role, the main content of the page should have a main role, any navigation list should have a navigation role, etc.  If this is not the case, a more appropriate landmark role should be used.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redundant landmarks have labels&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; It is OK for a unique landmark to not have a label.  However, if there is more than one of any given landmark role on the page, all of those landmarks must have labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landmark labels are unique and make sense&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; It doesn&#39;t help anyone to have two landmarks with the same label, especially if they are of the same role.  Also, landmark labels should effectively describe the content inside of their landmark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Landmarks... the source code test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am asking you to look at code too.  You can do this by viewing source (Ctrl-U) in your browser or by using your browser&#39;s developer tools.  Test for the following things in the page&#39;s source code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All content on the page is inside a landmark role&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; All means all: header logo, skip links, off-canvas navigation… everything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any content that should be put into a new landmark?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; There could be some complementary content inside the main content or a header inside a section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Landmarks are using the HTML5 semantic tags, not the role attribute&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; While the role attribute works, it is better form to use the HTML5 semantic tags for landmarks because it involves less code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pull up the list of links in your screen reader and test for the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links that go to different locations have unique names&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt; A bunch of links that go to different URLs but all have the same link text confuse users because they cannot tell the difference between these links.  These links must have unique link text or be given unique ARIA labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, I know. This is a long list.  But your users with thank you for all of this work.  I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gearing up for IUI #3</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/08/gearing-up-for-iui-3/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I apparently skipped writing about IUI #2. Sorry, folks. I am an inconsistent blogger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it has been a while, I will catch you all up now on my IUI rollercoaster. When I used that word in my last post, I had no idea how true it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Takes #1 and #2... nope!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can infer from the title of this post, my first two IUIs did not take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IUI #1 was a disaster. I was stressed and anxious through the entire two-week wait (TWW -- apparently &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; is an acronym), which led me to believe that &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; single feeling I had was a pregnancy symptom. No wonder that one didn&#39;t take. My body probably said to itself, &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Pfft. Are you crazy? You are&lt;/em&gt; way &lt;em&gt;too hyped up to do this. Veto!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IUI #2 was better. I was less anxious, but I kind of knew throughout it that it was not going to take. The procedure itself was awful. (Read: my cervix &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; did not want to be open for business.) The TWW was not terrible, though. The weird part was my breasts were super sore &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; it was made abundantly clear that I was not pregnant. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I did learn stuff, however.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last two months were no-go&#39;s, but they were not &lt;em&gt;complete&lt;/em&gt; wastes of time, since I learned a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whether I stress or not, it is what it is.&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot will myself to be pregnant. Trust me. I tried that the first time and that was terrible. I am taking some precautions. I am not drinking any alcohol during the TWW. I am cutting my sugar way down -- something I should be doing anyway. However, I am not stressing out if I want a burrito an hour after I eat mac and cheese. Because, come on. Burrito!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My workouts can&#39;t stop just because I may be growing a mini-me.&lt;/strong&gt; Anyone who truly knows me knows that I cannot stop working out. That will never happen, nor should it. My doctor even made it abundantly clear that I should work out. (However, she also said I should not go overboard. Who... me?!) During the TWW, I still worked out 5-6 days a week (my normal). However, I cut out my ab work. Completely. That was a terrible idea. Have you ever tried to do crunches after &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; doing crunches for 2 weeks? It&#39;s awful. I am out of the TWW right now and back to my normal routine... and I am &lt;strong&gt;sore&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My body does weird things when I put weird things into it.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, sperm is a weird thing when it comes to my body. Which is probably why the first two tries did not take. However, from the minute those little guys entered and through the TWW, I felt weird things. Hunger. Sore breasts. Hunger. Gas. Hunger. Tingling breasts. Hunger. &lt;em&gt;(Seriously... the food cravings were worse than my normal food cravings!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take #3... the next frontier!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next try will most likely be this Friday, August 11. I really hope this one actually takes. In all seriousness, each try is not only expensive, but it is emotionally exhausting, even when I am trying to relax and not stress over the whole thing. I marvel at the women who try for years. That takes an amount of emotional stamina that I am not sure I will have.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;m lost!: A brief introduction to web landmarks</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/07/brief-intro-to-landmarks/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s pretend for a minute that you are a new visitor to Washington DC. You look around and see a lot of streets, buildings, and other structures. You need to get from one point in the city to another. You ask me, a local, for directions. I could give you directions like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Go straight and then turn left at the thing. Walk along the thing through the thing. Make another left at the thing. Walk straight until you get to the thing!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, no one in their right mind would give directions like that. Let’s pretend that I can give you some more specific directions, but unfortunately, I don’t know the names of anything in this city. My directions would sound something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Go straight and then turn left at the memorial. Walk along the pool through the memorial. Make another left at the monument. Walk straight until you get to the building!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is better. Instead of “things”, we can now navigate the city by memorials, monuments, pools, and buildings. However, this still isn’t great. Like any city, there are multiple of each of these structures. You may be able to figure out where to go through some advanced logic and a really good map, but that makes life harder than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, everything in DC has a name and we can use these names to give even more specific directions, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Go straight and then turn left at the Lincoln Memorial. Walk along the Reflecting Pool through the WWII Memorial. Make another left at the Washington Monument. Walk straight until you get to the White House!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Navigating a website is no different&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept behind finding your way around a website is just like finding your way around a city. Instead of buildings and monuments, you would use HTML blocks to give your users cues as to what to expect where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fully-sighted user, a cue can be the site header or footer. It can be a featured video block. It can be a red emergency message box at the top of the page. It can be a sidebar containing an important note. You can make each of these blocks look distinct so that a sighted user can tell the difference between the site header and a sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A low- or no-vision user can use these same blocks to find their way around a web page. However, instead of using visual cues, like color or page placement, they use cues in the HTML code. These cues are called landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are specific HTML tags that serve as landmarks for web users. These tags describe major features of a page. They serve the same purpose as major features of a city, such as buildings and monuments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;caption class=&quot;sr-only&quot;&gt;List of HTML 5 landmark tags and their default roles&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;HTML 5 Tag&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Role&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;banner&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;navigation&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;main&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;main&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;aside&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;complementary&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;region&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;article&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;article&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;contentinfo&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;form&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sweet! How do I use landmark tags?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to using landmarks effectively is identifying the major sections of your website. Where are the site header and footer? What can be used as navigation? What major blocks of information exist on the page?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/mccourt-annotated.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;An example of how we identified landmarks on the McCourt School of Public Policy home page.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have identified all of your landmarks, contain that section using the appropriate HTML landmark tag. You can nest landmarks, too. In the above example, the site navigation is inside the site header. Therefore the &amp;lt;nav&amp;gt; tag is nested inside the &amp;lt;header&amp;gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Landmarks and why they rock&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;nav&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Landmarks&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;#&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Rocking&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/nav&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;
  All the things about landmarks.
&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Landmarks and labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A landmark is not very useful if you cannot tell them apart. Remember my first set of directions, where everything was &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;the thing&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Same concept here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A landmark&#39;s role is one way that users can tell the difference between landmarks. For example, screen readers will announce the role of a particular landmark. They will say “banner” for &amp;lt;header&amp;gt; tags and &amp;quot;navigation&amp;quot; for &amp;lt;nav&amp;gt; tags, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what happens when there is more than one landmark of a particular role on the page? For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of the incarnations of the Doctor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;section&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of the Doctor&#39;s companions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users will not be able to tell the difference right away between these two sections. A screen reader will see both sections, but the only piece of information it will initially give to the user is that there are two landmarks with the role of “region”. It’s like saying that there are two buildings in my city. This can be a problem if a user is only interested in one section, but not the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;strong&gt;labels&lt;/strong&gt; come in. You can give your landmarks unique labels using the aria-label attribute, so that users can distinguish one from another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labels are &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; for landmarks with redundant roles on the page. They are optional for any landmarks that are the only role of its kind. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;header&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Doctor Who!&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/header&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;section aria-label=&amp;quot;The Doctor&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of the incarnations of the Doctor.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;section aria-label=&amp;quot;The Doctor&#39;s companions&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;All of the Doctor&#39;s companions.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Anything else I need to know?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of additional requirements to know about when using landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every piece of content on your web page is required to be inside of a landmark.&lt;/strong&gt; Having content outside of any landmark is like having a couch in the middle of the street — it’s kind of weird and your couch really belongs in a building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always use the appropriate HTML landmark tag to markup your landmarks.&lt;/strong&gt; You could use the role attribute to assign a landmark role to another random tag — i.e. &amp;lt;div role=”banner”&amp;gt;. However, that is messy and not recommended. The HTML landmarks tags have their roles built in. Less code = better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure your landmark labels make sense to a human.&lt;/strong&gt; After all, they will be read by (or rather, to, via a screen reader) a human. So, don’t treat the labels like IDs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make sure your landmark labels are unique.&lt;/strong&gt; New York City does not have two Empire State buildings. Similarly, your webpage should not have two “All about the TARDIS” region landmarks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Stop putting text in images!</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/07/stop-putting-text-in-images/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t believe it is 2017 and I have to say this, but &lt;strong&gt;stop putting text in your #$@&amp;amp;*% images!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It boggles my mind that content editors and website managers think this is still OK, but I see it everywhere, so apparently this still needs to be spelled out for you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Images with text look like crap on small screens&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A giant poster with text and photos may look fantastic on your 1600×1200 screen, but try loading this on your iPhone 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure markdown=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
![Photo of a person sitting at a table behind a pile of books. The top book is open. The overlaid text reads: Reading. It does a body good.](/assets/images/posts/reading-poster.jpg)
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the image will scale down to fit your 320px wide screen, but I dare you to read all of of the image text without pinching to zoom in. Maybe all of you who have 20/15 vision, but I’m certainly not in that group, for one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Images with text are bad for accessibility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of people with imperfect vision, users with low- or no- vision use a screen reader to access your site. Screen readers go through a web page’s code and read all of visible content on that page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An image does not have machine readable content, so screen readers need to rely on the image’s alt text in the HTML to completely and accurately describe the image. For the image above, that alt text would have convey both the text in the image as well as the content of the image itself. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;reading-poster.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Photo of a person sitting at a table behind a pile of books. The top book is open. Text on top of the image reads: Reading. It does a body good.&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a lot of alt text. Arguably too much. Alt text should be descriptive, but it should not be a thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Separating your image and text is a win-win for everyone!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who are still putting text in images are clearly coming from an age where print and the web need to look exactly alike in all cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, folks — it’s 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Print is not the web. The web is not print. Moreover, the web does not look (or sound) the same for everyone. We as website owners and content creators need to be as flexible and accommodating to our users as possible if we want them to read the content we are giving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separating text from image allows both the text and image to be responsive and accessible. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;section class=&amp;quot;poster&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;books.jpg&amp;quot; alt=&amp;quot;Person sitting at a table behind a pile of books. The top book is open.&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;headline&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Reading.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;tagline&amp;quot;&amp;gt;It does a body good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/section&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans can read this. Screen readers can read this. With a few media queries, humans with tiny phones can read this. Everyone wins!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hopefully I convinced you.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who remain unconvinced, I will be starting an accessibility wall of shame.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bold and strong are not the same thing</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/07/bold-vs-strong/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;, and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; tags have all been a part of the HTML spec since nearly the beginning. All four of these tags were introduced in HTML 2. However, for a very long time, the community was focused on the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; tags only. It is only recently that the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; tags have become “popular”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; tags gained a reputation of being pretty much the same as the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; tags. After all, the default browser behavior of &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; are both the same, as is that of &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, systems formed opinions on the matter. CMS editors will insert &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; tags into your content when you click on the bold and italic button in the WYSIWYG editor. Some accessibility monitors even go so far as to say that &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; are the “correct” tags to use in situations where you want to bold or italicize something. They say that &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; should never be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is wrong. All four of these tags have different semantic meanings and can validly be used, depending on what you are trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; tags. The &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; tag should be used for phrases that you want to emphasize. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;do not&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; want to see a mess in my kitchen!&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; tag should be used for phrases that do not require emphasis, but should visually be bold. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I like &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;cookies&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;cakes&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;, but not pies.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are similar differences between the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; tags. The &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; tag should be used for phrases that you want to emphasize. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I am &amp;lt;em&amp;gt;extremely&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; excited about the Superbowl.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; tag should be used for phrases that do not require emphasis, but should be visually italicized. The &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; tag is often used when referencing book titles or foreign words. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I think &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Make Way For Ducklings&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is a classic piece of literature that all children should read.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, pay attention to your content.  How should it look?  How would it sound if you were to read it out loud? Should there be an emphasis on a particular word to drive your point?  The answers to these questions will guide which tag to use to support your content.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My first IUI rollercoaster</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/07/my-first-iui-rollercoaster/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don&#39;t know &lt;em&gt;(and many people don&#39;t)&lt;/em&gt;, I made the choice to become a single mother after years of debating this. My first actual attempt happened on June 17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to work with a fertility clinic at the beginning of this year and took all the tests. Everything came back great, considering my age. (I am now 39 years old.) My final tests completed in May and my doctor OK&#39;ed my first try for my June cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought that actually trying in June was realistic, mostly because of logistics. In the beginning of June, I was able to estimate my ovulation date and discovered that it coincided with an out-of-state conference that I was speaking at. Oops. I took ovulation tests anyway, so that I could verify at what point I ovulate in my cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, my ovulation test came back positive the day flew home from the conference. I scheduled the IUI for the following day. That was an ordeal. I went alone. I sat in the waiting room alone. The only people in the room for the actual procedure were the RE and a nurse. I was so nervous. I really wanted to ask the nurse to hold my hand, but was embarrassed to ask. The procedure itself was quick. I cried, mostly out of shear emotional exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two weeks were complete hell. I felt cramps for the first few days after the IUI, which is normal for IUIs. A few days later, I felt a sharp pinch in my belly. &lt;em&gt;(Implantation?)&lt;/em&gt; A few days after that I had &lt;strong&gt;the worst cramps&lt;/strong&gt; ever... and then nothing. Every symptom just vanished. I took an at-home pregnancy test ten days after the IUI. Negative. It was too early anyway. I took two more tests on days twelve and thirteen. Negative. The both of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pregnancy test with my doctor was scheduled for the morning of July 3. I started bleeding the night before. &lt;em&gt;Shit&lt;/em&gt;. It must be my period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My nurse asked me to go in for the test anyway and I did. Later that morning, I realized that I am still bleeding, but not as much as I normally do for my period. &lt;em&gt;(Maybe it&#39;s still early?)&lt;/em&gt; My breasts are tingling. &lt;em&gt;(Nerves? Stress?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short... nerves. This was definitely my period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If at first you don&#39;t succeed... try, try again. &lt;em&gt;(Sigh.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keyboard navigation when carousels block your way</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/04/keyboard-navigation-with-carousels/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Oh... carousels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carousels have become a major web design trend over the last several years. They are everywhere, from home pages to slideshows to product galleries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Carousels are terrible.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a content perspective, the majority of users only see the first slide. In a &lt;a href=&quot;https://erikrunyon.com/2013/01/carousel-interaction-stats/&quot;&gt;2013 carousel study on Notre Dame’s website&lt;/a&gt;, only 1% of users clicked on any call to action on their carousel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Carousels are this decade’s &amp;lt;blink&amp;gt; tag&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://shouldiuseacarousel.com/&quot;&gt;shouldiuseacarousel.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an accessibility perspective, carousels are even worse. Screen readers will ignore much of the content in a carousel. Keyboard navigation is difficult at best. Some carousels will simply make it difficult to navigate between slides. Others will make it virtually impossible to navigate past the carousel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;...carousels are generally not compliant with accessibility standards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/carousel/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap 4 alpha documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Do not use carousels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;But... I need to put this carousel on my page!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel your pain. I am willing to bet that most developers need to deal with carousels, even if they are a terrible, terrible idea. (See above.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work on a website that uses a Bootstrap 4 carousel on the home page. It works fine for sighted users. It is less fine for sight-impaired users. It is a nightmare for keyboard users. Our carousel allowed a keyboard user to tab into the first focusable element of the carousel. This element was the previous slide navigation button. However, they could not tab to any other element in the carousel. Or tab to the next feature on the page. Or tab backwards to the previous feature on the page. Our keyboard users were stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution, take 1.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the issue was with the ordering of the elements inside the carousel. I checked and rechecked the HTML for the carousel. I reordered the slides and navigation elements a couple of times. My HTML looked valid and semantic, but none of these attempts fixed my keyboard issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution, take 2.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then disabled JavaScript on the page. The carousel HTML looked and acted completely fine. This was because we styled the slides to display as individual cards for non-JavaScript users. I was able to tab from card to card with my keyboard. Aha! The issue is obviously in the JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution, take 3.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to tackle the tabbing issue by going through how a user would want to navigate through a carousel. My initial pseudocode looked something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (user pressed the tab key)
  if (user is on the first carousel element and going back)
    put the focus on the element immediately before the carousel
  else if (user is on the last carousel element and going forward)
    put the focus on the element immediately after the carousel
  else if (user is going back)
    put the focus on the previous element in the carousel
  else // user is going forward
    put the focus on the next element in the carousel
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding this in practice was actually terrible. The amount of code I was writing was quickly growing and becoming unmanageable. There were too many edge cases to worry about. Even my pseudocode had way too many if statements than I was comfortable with. There had to be a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The final version.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of help from many Google and Stack Overflow pages, I discovered a much better approach. The final pseudocode is now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (user pressed the tab key)
  if (focus did not change from where it was before)
    if (user is going back)
      put the focus on the previous focusable element
    else
      put the focus on the next focusable element
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done. I don’t care if there is a carousel or some other horrible keyboard trap on the page. This code will allow keyboard users to tab through anything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Check out and play with the code.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out the actual code in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/thatdevgirl/61ad6a7ece83d4a2515f5ce6d2110e00&quot;&gt;Handle tab focus Gist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A time-out to think</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/03/a-time-out-to-think/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My doctor-imposed 2-month delay on starting my treatment &lt;em&gt;(thank you chicken pox immunity woes)&lt;/em&gt; has given me a lot of time to think. Too much time, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tech world has a phenomenon called “imposter syndrome”, where you are working in a position that you deserve to be in, but you don’t &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you are good enough to be in that position. You do your work and you do it well, but all the while, you have thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t good enough. I shouldn’t be working on this. Someone else can do this better. The team will figure this out eventually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been having impostor syndrome about my own theoretical role as &lt;strong&gt;Mom&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My current inner dialog...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t do this. I won’t be good enough to raise a child. Especially not by myself. Lots of people can do this better. Lots of people &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; do this better. Someone will figure this out eventually.”
In my head, I go through all 18 years of this non-existent kid’s life in a matter of minutes and think about all the ways I will not be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time for a thought-shift.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in month 1 of this 2-month “wait for the chicken pox vaccine to work” hiatus. One month is more than enough time for my impostor syndrome thoughts to have life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to spend the next month churning up some real, positive thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have a lot of love.&lt;/strong&gt; (Though sometimes showing emotion is hard.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have a lot of experience.&lt;/strong&gt; (That’s my way of saying being older is awesome.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have a lot of quirk.&lt;/strong&gt; (Life is too short to be “normal”.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therefore, I have a lot to give to my future child.&lt;/strong&gt; (Screw you, impostor syndrome. I’m awesome!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Testing, the final tally</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/02/testing-the-final-tally/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am finally (gloriously) done with the testing phase. I actually finished last week, but have been procrastinating writing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week was intense between the HSG, an appointment with the counselor, and the final blood work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Counseling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most, if not all, clinics require patients to have at least one visit with a social worker or psychologist. My doctor made sure to stress that this visit is not a test or a screening. It is simply an additional resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The psychologist I saw was very helpful. She had a lot of insight and great advice. However, I found myself leaving with more questions — or rather more homework — than before I saw her. There is a &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; of things to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where do I get sperm?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question is especially complicated because I am currently debating between an anonymous donor and a known donor. &lt;em&gt;(This is a post that I am not ready to write yet.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest takeaways on this topic are that I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need to speak with my potential known donor and figure out what is right for the both of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; my support system?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My local support system is woefully sparse. It is something I have always known, but I am constantly questioning whether it is something I am OK with. My closest family member is a 4 hour drive away. I have close friends in the area, but friends are not family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest takeaway on this topic is that I need to find a support system. Or a support group. I really need to talk to someone who is doing what I am doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two giant questions. Two giant pieces of homework. More on this is (many) future posts, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blood work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, everything is great. I did encounter a minor, fixable road block — I am not immune to the chicken pox. This is pretty important because if I do get the chicken pox &lt;em&gt;while pregnant&lt;/em&gt; (or, rather, shingles), that is really bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irritating part of this test result is that I was vaccinated for the chicken pox 7 years ago, as an adult. &lt;em&gt;(This story behind this is one for another time.)&lt;/em&gt; For whatever reason, that vaccine did not take. My doctor is completely baffled by this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I am getting re-vaccinated. The vaccine consists of 2 shots, 4 weeks apart, with a 1 month hold after the last shot. Therefore, this puts a 2 month hold on starting my treatment, because I cannot get pregnant while taking the vaccine. (Again, chicken pox + fetus = bad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The upside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccine shot #1 happened today. So, I have 2 months to get all my homework done. Having that time is actually a relief.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HSG: The final (testing) frontier</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/02/hsg-the-final-testing-frontier/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an intense week of testing due to scheduling and where I am in my cycle. I had my last test today, the HSG, or hysterosalpingogram. &lt;em&gt;(Say that five times fast.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HSG is simply an X-ray of most of your girl parts. The purpose is to make sure your fallopian tubes are open. Open tubes means your eggs can travel from your ovaries to your uterus without any problems. Closed tubes means your parts are closed for business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a super quick test that they say feels almost like a pap smear. It does not. In reality, the speculum is the only part that is similar to a pap smear. During the test, they insert dye into the cervix. The X-ray machine is used to watch the dye as it travels through your system. Your tubes are open if the dye makes it to your ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going in, I thought the HSG was a big, long procedure. It is not. It literally takes 5 minutes. Seriously. Giving my urine sample took longer. (Then again, I didn’t really have to pee. Oops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are reading about the HSG, you have probably read that there could be some cramping and spotting. Your mileage may vary, but that was a big old  &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt; for me to both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here were the &amp;quot;oh my&amp;quot; points of my visit. I don’t want to scare you, so skip ahead if you don’t want to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The speculum pinched.&lt;/strong&gt; A lot. Then again, I was super tense. My advice: relax. (Easier said than done, right? I mean, telling someone to relax is probably the least effective way to actually get someone to relax. But seriously, relax.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dye made me cramp.&lt;/strong&gt; It was about as bad as when I cramp for my period. I imagine that this was my body saying, &amp;quot;what on earth did you just put into me?!?&amp;quot; It went away within a couple of minutes. I did take an ibuprofen ahead of time. I like to think that helped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am definitely spotting.&lt;/strong&gt; I have no idea if I’m spotting blood or dye, but something is coming out. The techs said it should stop by tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like ending with &amp;quot;yay&amp;quot; points, so here are a couple of those:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone was super nice.&lt;/strong&gt; I saw a total of 3 different people: the intake nurse and two technicians. Everyone explained everything that would happen and then again as it was happening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The workflow was very efficient.&lt;/strong&gt; I basically followed a path from initial chat to urine sample to undressing to test to redressing. There were pads and wet wipes at the end. It was one of the best doctor user experiences I have seen. (As a web developer, I appreciate good UX.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, in case you were curious, all systems are go for me. May yours be as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prep work update</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/02/prep-work-update/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took a couple baby steps in the last 24 hours to prepare my brain and body for the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prenatal vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped by the store after work last night for a couple of things and figured it was time to start the prenatal vitamins. I have been a daily multi-vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stood in the vitamin aisle for quite a file trying to find the prenatal ones. There were very few options in the rows of vitamins A, B12, C, D, Fish Oil, K, etc. I finally found 2 options: pill and gummy. I hate pills, so I gravitated towards the gummy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought: Why is there crystalized sugar on them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously. My regular gummy vitamin is sort of like a gummy bear. All gummy. No sugar crystals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My second thought: Why on earth do I need this? I mean, I get it. My body should be equipped with all of the vitamins and minerals it needs to prep itself for a potential baby and this will help. On the other hand, I am pretty sure my mother never took supplements before she conceived. My grandmother surely didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At any rate, progress!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reproduction and genetics class&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, seriously. My clinic sent me a link to an online course they offer, as pre-work for my treatment. I have a bit of a science background, but not in biology. My last biology class was a lot of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class started with a review of basic genetics. It concentrated on what genetic tests are used to look for both dominant and recessive diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the primary focus of the class was on the reproductive cycle and how treatment augments that cycle. This depends on how much treatment a woman needs. Treatment can be basic for women with few fertility issues: “here is the point in which we introduce sperm”. On the other hand, treatment can be more complicated for women with more severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am on the “easy” side of the spectrum (so far!), but seeing the process for all cases was remarkably helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend asking your potential clinic options about their education options. You may know all about how your body works and all about the reproductive cycle. However, choosing a clinic that cares about the education aspect is super important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shows that they want you to know exactly what your body will undergo during this conception process. This process feels like a very personal science experiment. It may work. It may not. There are plenty of variables and, therefore, even more outcomes. Knowing the parameters of this experiment is critical.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A new beginning</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/01/a-new-beginning/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had my initial consultation with Clinic Beta today. I had some initial concern that my experience with this new clinic would mimic that of Clinic Alpha. I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat down with the doctor and we went over my initial paperwork, as well as my past test results. I briefly explained why I switched clinics. However, e mostly concentrated on the fact that I should be a relatively easy case. So far, my test results look good — really good considering my age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I should be able to get away with only using artificial insemination (IUI). This is a relief, since that is the only treatment my insurance will cover. There will still be out-of-pocket costs, but not as many as before. I do not have to pay hundreds of dollars to see my doctor. I do not have to sign up and pay for a $2000+ package deal before getting any testing done. So far, it seems that all I will have to pay for out-of-pocket are co-pays, some lab work (maybe), and sperm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong. I am lucky enough to be able to afford to pay for these things. In the back of my mind, I remember something I read a while back: if you cannot afford to pay to conceive a baby, you cannot afford a baby. I (mostly) agree with this. I mean, kids are &lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt;! However, that does not mean that I should stop trying to be economical about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, there are few things I still need to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blood work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HSG — an x-ray that checks to see if my tubes are open&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social worker — not a test, but someone I can use as a resource&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find sperm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be able to complete these steps over the course of the next month. Which means….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;March&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can theoretically start trying to conceive in March. That is both exciting and terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking action when you have social anxiety</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/01/taking-action-when-you-have-social-anxiety/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I attended the Women’s March on January 21, 2017. This march that was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.politicususa.com/2017/01/21/womens-march-biggest-protest-history-estimated-2-4-million-march.html&quot;&gt;largest inaugural protest in US history&lt;/a&gt;, with over 500,000 people in DC alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have anxiety disorder and my anxiety is strongest when I am around large groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My March experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel lots of things emotionally and physically when I am anxious. This is a sample of what I felt at the March:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restlessness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being easily fatigued&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Muscle tension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worry for days before an event where other people will be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficulty concentrating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before the March, I was very anxious about the thought of attending something originally named “The Million Woman March”. I worried for weeks about it. I actually made up my mind to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; go for a very long time. One million is a really, really big number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that, attending the March remained in the back of my mind. I am woefully unrepresented in the current administration. I fear the Trump presidency will use my sexuality, my race, and my gender as excuses to take away my rights as a human. The desire to be heard was — is — important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ultimately went to the March because a group of supportive friends whom I trust asked if I wanted to go. I said yes because this is important. I also said yes because I really, really, really want my anxiety to not get in the way of things that are important to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That group made the experience so much better, despite the anxiety. The March was a memorable, important, and empowering day. I am so thankful that I was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/womens-march-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Protester holding a sign with the text Love and Courage&quot; :width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have social anxiety — or any kind of anxiety — you may not make the same decision I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alternative actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are actions we can take that are less anxiety-inducing. Here are a few quick ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#1. Contact your representatives in Congress.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phone calls are more effective, but if an email or a letter is all you can muster the energy for, do it. Social media seems to be the least effective method of contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write a script&lt;/strong&gt;. Contacting people is so much easier if you know what you want to say ahead of time. Your message can be short and simple. Here is a template you can use:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hello. I am _______, a constituent calling to ask &amp;lt;Name&amp;gt; to put pressure on President Trump to &amp;lt;Specific Thing&amp;gt;. This is important to me because &amp;lt;Reasons&amp;gt;. Please ask the &amp;lt;Name&amp;gt; to &amp;lt;Do Specific Thing&amp;gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a schedule&lt;/strong&gt;. When and how often do you want to make contact? Your choice could be just once for a specific upcoming vote or once a week for ongoing issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find contact information.&lt;/strong&gt; There is contact information online for your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm&quot;&gt;Senators&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.house.gov/representatives/&quot;&gt;Representative&lt;/a&gt;. There is also a great website that will &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/&quot;&gt;find your Representative&lt;/a&gt;, if you need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make the call. Send the email.&lt;/strong&gt; No one is judging you on the other end, but they are listening.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#2. Pick one cause and see how you can help out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a particular cause that you are passionate about? I will bet there is a local organization out there that can use your help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you find an organization that speaks to you, shoot them an email and ask if they need any help! You don’t have to canvas your neighborhood or make 40,000 phone calls to help most places. Organizations can use help in other ways too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web developers can offer technical help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artists can offer web and print design help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accountants can offer bookkeeping help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get the idea. We all have valuable life skills that can we can use to help a volunteer organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#3. Help a cause without contact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you find an organization that speaks to you, but are stressed out about making contact? It’s OK! You can still help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow that organization on social media. This way, you can stay informed about their cause and what they are doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share their posts with your friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Donate to them if you have the means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;#4. Breath and be kind.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is energized and arguably crazy right now. It will do everyone a world of good to simply breath and be nice to one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/womens-march-02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Young girl holding a sign saying Be Nice&quot; :width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The dilemma: A brief introduction</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/01/the-dilemma-a-brief-introduction/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want a baby. I am also a single woman, a fact that does not seem to be changing anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes me think I can handle raising another human being by myself? The last living member of the animal kingdom I took care of died in 1994… and it was a goldfish. Debbie Gibson &lt;em&gt;(the fish)&lt;/em&gt; had a fantastic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;In theory I have a plan.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a web developer, I am in a profession where I can easily work from home. All I need is a laptop and a solid internet connection. I am lucky enough to work for a place where I can already work from home 1 day a week. I plan to stay there for a long time, so I only need to worry about daycare 4 days a week, theoretically. There is a daycare on campus, but only once future-baby is 18 months old. Day care is expensive, as are nannies. I need to do more research here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Insert panic here….&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about when future-baby becomes future-small-child &lt;em&gt;(FSC)&lt;/em&gt;? FSC starts school. No more daycare! But then we start the morning routines. Class-wide germ epidemics. Getting excited about learning. Homework. Explosion of toys. After-school things. Parental controls on all the electronics. Growing up. Puberty. Growing up too fast? Panic attacks about the cute kid FSC has a crush on and all of a sudden we are having “the talk” and what did I get myself into?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That paragraph up there is the mental panic I have more often than not these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet this 38-year old single introverted woman still wants a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So… what is this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it might be interesting to chronicle my journey into voluntary single motherhood. Feel free to follow along. Advice welcome. Please be gentle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A complicated tale of research</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2017/01/a-complicated-tale-of-research/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a tale of two fertility clinics. I do not want to use names, so I’ll call them &lt;em&gt;Clinic Alpha&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Clinic Beta&lt;/em&gt; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gynecologist referred me to &lt;em&gt;Clinic Alpha first&lt;/em&gt;. I had an initial consultation with them last month. &lt;em&gt;Clinic Alpha&lt;/em&gt; gave me books and white papers, took blood, and poked at my privates to make sure everything is OK. Thankfully, everything is, in fact, OK. Fantastic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clinic Alpha&lt;/em&gt; and my insurance both confirmed that none of this endeavor would be covered unless I could prove that I have been trying to have a baby for 2 years. Fine. I could accept that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked &lt;em&gt;Clinic Alpha&lt;/em&gt; for clarification on what I would need to do from now until conception and how much (roughly) each step would cost. Long story short, that was not a simple answer. It was not a single answer, in fact, and in a couple of cases, the answers I got contradicted each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, I was told that I would have to pay for each step up front — to the point where I could not even speak to anyone but the financial department without paying them something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not want to rant too much, but suffice it to say, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable with &lt;em&gt;Clinic Alpha&lt;/em&gt; at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started, v2.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I called &lt;em&gt;Clinic Beta&lt;/em&gt; today. I gave them the brief overview of what I have done so far and my issues with &lt;em&gt;Clinic Alpha&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Clinic Beta&lt;/em&gt; confirmed that they do take my insurance, but I would need to call my insurance company for the nitty gritty details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, back to the insurance company. This time, they told me that, while IVF is definitely not covered under my plan, artificial insemination (IUI) is. In fact, it is covered 100% and in-network doctor visits would end up being billed as specialist visits, in which case I would only have to pay a copay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well… that’s different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could also work. Assuming my girl parts are as amazing as the &lt;em&gt;Clinic Alpha&lt;/em&gt; doctor seems to think they are, all I may need is IUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grilled the (extremely helpful and patient) insurance rep with so many questions and then asked her to send me all of this information to my email, so that I would have a copy of this coverage in writing. (She did.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I can go to &lt;em&gt;Clinic Beta&lt;/em&gt; with my initial test results from &lt;em&gt;Clinic Alpha&lt;/em&gt; and, ideally, have the rest of this endeavor be covered under insurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this assumes that artificial insemination will work and I will not need to go the IVF route. This plan seems feasible so far, but it’s still very, very early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breathe. My financial anxiety has decreased a lot after that second call with the insurance company, and especially now that I have that information in writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call &lt;em&gt;Clinic Alpha&lt;/em&gt; to get hard copies of my initial test results from them. That should be an interesting conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet with &lt;em&gt;Clinic Beta.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hope the science experiment I am performing on my body all goes to plan. I give this 50/50 odds that we stick to this plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Not making new year resolutions</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2016/12/not-making-new-year-resolutions/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a year. Some of us have had a really rough year, while others had a pretty good year, but feel awkward admitting that 2016 wasn&#39;t all that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2015, I had asked for a stranger new year. Not quite what I mean, but I think I got it. It was definitely a year filled with some pretty awful things, but a friend inspired me to focus on the positive, so here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After getting laid off from a particularly toxic job at the end of 2015, I spent this year reinventing myself professionally. I started my own one-woman consulting business. I started teaching (and really liked it). One of my clients turned into a full-time job that I am really loving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After burning out from running at the end of 2015 and having several terrible arguments with my joints, my knees and I have finally made peace and agreed upon a new running schedule that is making us all happy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was an exciting travel year, not so much in quantity, but definitely quality.  This year, I found myself in Alaska the week before my birthday with a fantastic group of friends.  I took a mini-trip in the fall to Minnesota and rounded out the year with a road trip through New England to ring in 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part where I make resolutions for next year, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I hate resolutions.  I resolve to run more or save more or read more or ride a unicorn across the country. And then do none of these things. And then feel bad when I look back and the end of the year and realize that I did none of these things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, no resolutions here! My plan is to be realistic and do things that are useful or joyful.  Shoot! Is that a resolution in disguise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy new year everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accessibility and phone number formatting</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2016/11/accessibility-phone-number-formatting/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accessible phone numbers on the web is a more complicated topic than you would think.  Screen readers are remarkably inconsistent in the way they handle phone numbers.  This is a huge issue from an accessibility point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Highlighting the problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A US phone number is normally written as “(703) 555-1212”. A screen reader will read this number as “seven hundred three &lt;em&gt;(pause)&lt;/em&gt; five hundred fifty-five minus one thousand two hundred twelve.” The digits are read as large numbers.  The reader treats the exchange and number as a math equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another example, a screen reader will read “703.555.1212” as “seven hundred three &lt;em&gt;(pause)&lt;/em&gt; five hundred fifty-five &lt;em&gt;(pause)&lt;/em&gt; one thousand two hundred twelve.” At least it is no longer a math equation, but the numbers are still read as large singular numbers, not as digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using a tel: link&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most obvious solution should be to add your phone number as a “tel” link and hope that screen readers are smart enough to know how to read the numbers inside the link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;tel:7035551212&amp;quot;&amp;gt;(703) 555-1212&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers are not that smart.  However, in their defense, links can include any content, from a phone number to regular text, such as “Click here to call our department.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a usability perspective, I advocate for using the “tel” link as a partial solution. This does not help with our screen reader issue at all.  However, it does make phone numbers more accessible for mobile phone users, since these user can easily place a call by tapping the phone number. &lt;em&gt;(You can always use CSS to make the number look clickable on mobile devices and not clickable on desktop devices.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Super clunky HTML solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my Google searching travels, I did come across an idea to separate the phone number into pronounceable chunks with span tags. Given how screen readers read larger numbers, I would imagine that would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;7&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;0&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;3&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;5&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; - &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s just me, but that looks terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CSS solution?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also consider creating a CSS speech media query for your content. I find that clunky because it separates the content between my HTML and CSS. (Whether you consider pronunciation as content or style can be up for debate. I personally think of it as content.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, there was also a specification proposal for a reader media type, but that proposal appears to have been scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ARIA labels – a more reasonable solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best solution I came across is to use an ARIA label to specify how the screen reader should read a particular piece of text. ARIA labels are designed to tell screen readers how to read things, which is exactly our issue here. Combining the ARIA label with our “tel” link recommendation for above, we arrive at the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;tel:7035551212&amp;quot; aria-label=&amp;quot;7 0 3. 5 5 5. 1 2 1 2.&amp;quot;&amp;gt;(703) 555-1212&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note the spaces and periods in the label. The spaces in the label tell the screen reader to read each digit individually. The period after the area code and the exchange tell the screen reader to pause (like at the end of a sentence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution is a bit more complex than our simple “tel” link. However, it is preferable because it keeps our content together (the displayed number and the pronunciation guide).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accessibility testing: Screen reader edition</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2016/09/accessibility-screen-reader/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accessibility testing on our websites is a large, large topic.  I am writing about testing with screen readers here, but please keep in mind that accessibility testing != screen reader testing alone.  There is a already great article from Viget about web accessibility testing in general – “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.viget.com/articles/how-to-do-web-accessibility-qa-part-1/&quot;&gt;How to do Web Accessibility QA&lt;/a&gt;“.  (Be sure to read both parts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a screen reader?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A screen reader is a piece of software installed on your computer that will read everything on your screen, including websites, applications, and the operating system UI in general.  Screen readers are not just for websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of different screen readers out there – JAWS &lt;em&gt;(Windows, paid)&lt;/em&gt;, NVDA &lt;em&gt;(Windows, free)&lt;/em&gt;, VoiceOver &lt;em&gt;(Mac)&lt;/em&gt;, and plenty more.  To help you find the reader that is right for you, check out this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.itcs.umich.edu/atcs/screenreaders.php&quot;&gt;overview of the major screen readers&lt;/a&gt; and this &lt;a href=&quot;http://accessibilitychatter.com/?p=18&quot;&gt;screen reader comparison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screen readers will read your website as long as your browser is the active window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open the screen reader.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open your web browser of choice.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to the site you are testing.&lt;/strong&gt; The first thing the screen reader will generally read is the website title – i.e. anything inside the &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; HTML tags.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, you can start navigating the site using your keyboard.  All navigation commands generally involve a software key. This is simply a key on your keyboard that indicates to the screen reader that you are issuing it a command. This can vary by software and is often customizable. &lt;em&gt;(For example, the default JAWS key is the INSERT key.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The UP/DOWN arrow keys let you navigate through the page.&lt;/strong&gt; You will be navigating the page based on the order of the HTML elements in the DOM.  Navigation has nothing to do with their visual order on the screen.  The down arrow will lead you to the next element on the page.  The up arrow will lead you to the previous element on the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Press ENTER to visit a link.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do I know where I am on the page?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen reader will read the text on the page &lt;em&gt;(or, ideally, the alt text of images on the page)&lt;/em&gt;.  For the most part, you will hear the actual content on the page.  In some cases, the reader will give you context clues about what an element is – particularly if that element is interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each reader is slightly different in the way it reads the content and presents these context clues.   The following examples are from the JAWS screen reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links:&lt;/strong&gt; JAWS will read the text of the link, followed by literally the word “link”.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have already visited that link, it will say “visited link” instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the link goes to another section of the same page you are on, it will say something like “same page link”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigation blocks:&lt;/strong&gt; JAWS will preface navigation menus with the word “menu”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lists:&lt;/strong&gt; JAWS will say “List of # items” before reading any list items, where “#” is the number of items in the list.  This is true of both &amp;lt;li&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;ol&amp;gt; lists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Images:&lt;/strong&gt; JAWS will preface any image alt text with the word “graphic”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actually Testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does take a bit of practice to get the hang of navigating a site with a screen reader.  Once you are comfortable with the tool, you can start concentrating on the important parts of your testing.  While you are testing your site, keep these questions in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the content being read to me understandable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I close my eyes, would I have any idea how to accomplish my goal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I close my eyes and interact with a page element, is it easy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer to any of these questions is no, then you have found an item that needs to be fixed!  Make a note of the difficulties you had.  The fix could be something simple, like adding alt text to an image where it is missing, or something more complicated, like having to retool a form to make it easier to use with a keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When Git ignore doesn&#39;t</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2016/09/when-git-ignore-doesnt/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine this: You have a file in your Git repository that you need to modify. Perhaps it is a settings file for your CMS. The settings file works perfectly for your QA or production environment, but you need to modify it for your local environment to run off of a different port or to enable developer logging or to do whatever else.  These local changes are critical to your local environment, but they will not work on production. No matter what, you &lt;strong&gt;must not&lt;/strong&gt; commit these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is your first instinct?  You add the file to &lt;em&gt;.gitignore&lt;/em&gt;. You run &lt;em&gt;git status&lt;/em&gt;.  The file still appears as modified. You look at &lt;em&gt;.gitignore&lt;/em&gt; again.  Maybe play around with the path.  You double and triple check the path and the file name. You make a change, thinking this is absolutely the correct path.  You run git status again. The file still appears as modified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Insert an absurd amount of screaming here.  Or maybe that’s just me.&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth is, using &lt;em&gt;.gitignore&lt;/em&gt; to ignore a file that has already been committed to your repository will do absolutely nothing.  Git will only actually ignore files that are in your local environment, but &lt;strong&gt;not in the repository&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoying, but it makes sense.  Git is responsible for any committed files and asking Git to ignore a file that it is responsible for is like asking a teacher to ignore one of her students.  &lt;em&gt;“Hey Ms. Jones.  I know Tommy is in your class and you need to teach him things, but could you please ignore him instead?”&lt;/em&gt; Sounds a bit silly, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need Git to ignore changes you make to this committed file locally, but Git cannot ignore the file.  So, you have two choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delete the file from the repository, then ignore it.&lt;/strong&gt;  Great idea if you do not need the file to exist for other users or environments.  Probably not so great for our settings file that production probably needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell Git to assume that the file never changes.&lt;/strong&gt;  Git has a command called update-index that is pretty powerful.  For our purposes, we can use it to tell Git to pretend that we will never change this file, regardless of whether or not this is actually true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;git update-index --assume-unchanged FILE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you can make whatever changes you want to your file.  The original file still exists as-is on the repository and Git will look the other way about your changes.  Win-win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/docs/git-update-index&quot;&gt;Git’s documentation on update-index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Solving my internal CSS framework debate</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2016/05/my-css-framework-debate/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just when I finished teaching my students about CSS frameworks, I come across an article telling me that “&lt;a href=&quot;https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/you-might-not-need-a-css-framework/&quot;&gt;You Might Not Need a CSS Framework.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not telling my students yet.  Let’s just say that is too much too soon.  (I teach beginners.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I have been debating this myself for quite a while now.  It generally goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m starting a new site.  I need a framework!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But it makes development so much easier…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… which then your HTML looks terrible&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And I get a whole host of responsive features for free...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;... with CSS that is a pain to override because the selectors are hyper-specific&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But all of these features have been tested and are cross-browser compatible...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;... but my site’s performance all goes to pot because the framework is so bloated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so on and so on.  I can keep this debate going forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that is a debate – one which I hope to keep debating.  I will never tell myself that CSS frameworks are useless and a dying breed.  However, I do strongly believe that they have a time and a place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why CSS frameworks are great&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick prototyping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establishing consistent styles throughout a site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting code standards on a site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point is especially important if you find yourself maintaining a large site with a larger team.  A CSS framework is fixed and &lt;em&gt;(ideally)&lt;/em&gt; has documentation that everyone on the team can reference.  There is a high likeliness that new people to the team will already know the framework &lt;em&gt;(or, at least, a framework)&lt;/em&gt;, which makes on-boarding so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why CSS frameworks are terrible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bloated HTML with numerous nested tags (for containers) and a comical number of classes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So much overall code, potentially causing a performance hit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overly specific CSS selectors, making it super difficult to override in a custom stylesheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point brought in a lot of stress in my class and forced me to teach my students about the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;!important&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; CSS modifier.  Teaching that brought me some physical pain, but it did also allow me to teach my students about making decisions about their code.  As the saying goes, &lt;em&gt;“with great power, comes great responsibility”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The winner of my debate is...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfft.  I have no idea.  There really is no winner.  I could side with the frameworks and accept the bloat.  I could side against the frameworks and roll my own grid, features, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real “winner” &lt;em&gt;(if you can call it that)&lt;/em&gt; is my own ability to weigh my options and figure out what is best for whatever project I am working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are the cons against using a framework acceptable on a project that is complex and needs to be done quickly?  Great!  Let’s use the framework.  Are the pros of using a framework not enough to justify using it on a project that is hyper-sensitive about performance?  Fine – I will roll my own features and do everything I can towards efficiency.  (Perhaps some day I can even use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/&quot;&gt;CSS Grid&lt;/a&gt; on a production project.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, my decision making process will rarely be this straightforward, but this is a good start. Regardless, I am happy to entertain the debate with every project.  The debate is important.  Having choices is important.  Websites are not one-size-fits-all productions and the process of developing for them should not be either.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>4 ways teaching code made me a better developer</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2016/02/teaching-code-made-me-a-better-developer/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Late last year, the good folks at General Assembly hired me to teach one of their part-time &lt;a href=&quot;https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development/washington-dc&quot;&gt;Front-End Web Development&lt;/a&gt; courses.  I have been coding for years and, more recently, have given a few one-off guest lectures.  However, I was never completely in charge of the education of a group of people for any extended period of time… until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to late February – 10 weeks later.  My class is fantastic.  My students have learned so much, especially considering they started out as “non-geeks” who had never written a line of code before.  Their final projects look amazing.  But I won’t go into that, nor will I go into the sheer terror I felt on my first day of class or how much better I feel about public speaking.  Those are topics for another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 weeks, I noticed that I have become a stronger developer.  I considered myself to be a strong developer before this class, but over the course of this class, I have changed, along with my students, in a few different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I talk about code more specifically.&lt;/strong&gt; I used to be the queen of talking about my code in terms of “this block” or “that block inside of that other block”.  However, as a teacher, I have had to force myself to use less pronouns and be more specific about the words that I use because my students are honing in on every word and call me out when I say something that makes sense in my head but is confusing when it comes out of my mouth.  So, instead of referring to my code as “that” and “this”, I now say things like “the child block of the element with the ID of ‘foo&#39;” or “the click event that is using the class name ‘bar’ as a selector”.  More specific = clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I strengthened my core.&lt;/strong&gt;  Teaching a beginner programming class means that I have to start explaining code from the very beginning.  &lt;em&gt;What is a program?  What is the difference between HTML and CSS?&lt;/em&gt;  I have had conversations about parts of programming that I have taken for granted for years.  Being able to articulate programming concepts, like what a variable really is or why jQuery needs so darn much punctuation, has made me more conscientious about the code I write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I actually write pseudo-code.&lt;/strong&gt; Nine times out of ten, I write code in my head before I actually type it out.  Sometimes I think in code.  Call me weird, but it works and, sometimes, it is faster for me.  YMMV.  The issue comes when I have to comment my code.  &lt;em&gt;What is this line actually doing?  Why do I have that conditional there?&lt;/em&gt;  I taught my class to write pseudo-code in their JavaScript files as comments before they started writing real code.  I now practice what I preach and – voila! – instant comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am now the queen of analogies.&lt;/strong&gt;  Explaining complicated, or even simple, coding concepts to people who have never written code before is definitely an art.  It helps to associate new concepts with mental models that people are already familiar with.  It is like explaining the concept of a site wireframe in terms of writing an outline for your high school term paper.  We all had to write term papers – a site wireframe is the boxy-looking, graphical equivalent of our term paper outlines for websites.  I improv analogies a lot in class, especially when see a sea of blank, confused stares after explaining something like a for-loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure I have changed in other ways too, like my now-willingness to talk about code in front of large groups.  Or talk about anything in front of large groups, for that matter.  But, again, that is a topic for another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Speaking of “this”, using the word “this” as a pronoun when you are giving a lecture on the JavaScript keyword “this” is both hilarious and frustrating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Complicated and loving it</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2016/01/complicated-and-loving-it/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2015 was a strange, strange year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the year with a brand new job that had a ton of potential.  I later discovered working for that particular company was a huge mistake and, after being miserable for several months, had the opportunity to walk away in October.  After about 5 minutes of soul-searching &lt;em&gt;(long winded introspection is not really my thing)&lt;/em&gt;, I decided that jumping to another company would be another mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So I decided to go rogue.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, why work as a consultant through an agency when I can simply work as a consultant as myself?  Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is completely crazy.  Agencies exist for a reason and I have &lt;em&gt;zero&lt;/em&gt; experience in the business world.  I have never had to market myself to anyone.  Not to mention deal with invoicing and contracts and taxes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me about 2 minutes of soul-searching before I hit send on my first batch of &amp;quot;cold-call&amp;quot; marketing messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fast forward 2 months.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very close to launching my first client site as a &amp;quot;rogue&amp;quot; developer.  I have 2 more sites in progress.  I am teaching my very own class at &lt;a href=&quot;https://generalassemb.ly/&quot;&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt;.  And, I just signed 2 long-term contracts with a couple of really big organizations.  &lt;em&gt;(Not dropping names yet, but you&#39;ve definitely heard of them.  And one rhymes with &amp;quot;Shmacys&amp;quot;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad for someone with no practical business experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, my work life is more complicated.  My schedule is more complicated.  Taxes are more complicated.  &lt;em&gt;(Thank goodness for CPAs.)&lt;/em&gt;  But having control over my own time and flexibility?  Priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A few of my favorite (dev) things</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2015/12/my-favorite-dev-things/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started teaching a web development class and I have been thinking a lot about what happens after class is over.  My students will learn a bunch of HTML and CSS and a bit of JavaScript over the course of 10 weeks.  After that, development gets harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; options about what languages to learn, platforms to work with, and frameworks to use.  New languages and libraries are released constantly.  New versions of these languages and libraries are released constantly.  There are always new techniques, standards, and tips to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite interview questions is “How do you stay current?”  I love hearing candidates answer this question because it tells me 2 things about them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do they realize that you have to keep learning new things to stay relevant in our world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are they serious about keeping up?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no single right answer to this question (though there are plenty of wrong answers).  This is simply my answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JavascriptAgent&quot;&gt;@JavascriptAgent&lt;/a&gt; – JS tweets!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily&quot;&gt;@JavascriptDaily&lt;/a&gt; – More JS tweets!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dcww&quot;&gt;@dcww&lt;/a&gt; – Twitter account for DC Web Women.  Great group, probably more helpful if you are in DC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/startupvitamins&quot;&gt;@startupvitamins&lt;/a&gt; – Motivation for startups and independent contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blogs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tympanus.net/codrops/&quot;&gt;Codrops&lt;/a&gt; - A design and development blog.  Great stuff in here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://konigi.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Konigi&lt;/a&gt; - A blog all about UX design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.viget.com/articles/&quot;&gt;Viget’s Extend Blog&lt;/a&gt; - Viget is a consulting firm based in the DC area.  Their Extend blog is all about code &amp;amp; tech.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://littlebigdetails.com/&quot;&gt;Little Big Details&lt;/a&gt; - Bite-sized bits of design inspiration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;E-mail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://javascriptweekly.com/&quot;&gt;JavaScript Weekly&lt;/a&gt; - I am a JavaScript developer. This makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://responsivedesign.is/newsletter/&quot;&gt;Responsive Design Weekly&lt;/a&gt; - Weekly e-mail newsletter, all about responsive design.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twit.tv/shows/tech-news-today&quot;&gt;Tech News Today&lt;/a&gt; - Daily (weekdays) podcast about the latest technology news.&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Living dangerously: 12 thoughts on Windows 10 after day 1</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2015/07/thoughts-on-windows-10-after-day-1/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to live dangerously, at least in terms of upgrading my technology.  Call it reckless.  Call it crazy.  I just like playing with new things.  This is exactly why I decided to upgrade my 3-year old Windows 7 machine to Windows 10 &lt;a href=&quot;https://lifehacker.com/how-to-skip-the-line-and-upgrade-to-windows-10-now-1720854489&quot;&gt;the day it came out&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I do upgrade spontaneously, I also upgrade responsibly.  I made sure I squared away all of my backups.  Yes, that is plural. I have a local backup drive and a cloud backup service.  This girl doesn&#39;t mess around when it comes to my data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I really hated the new OS.  The upgrade process took forever.  Both during and after the update, my computer was so loud that sounded like it was about to be cleared for takeoff and so hot that I thought it would spontaneously combust.  Everything was slow.  I mean, &lt;em&gt;s. l. o. w.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I started tweaking the computer.  I uninstalled a bunch of old applications and upgraded others.  Here are a bunch of lessons learned from this process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uninstall the Intel Rapid Storage application.&lt;/strong&gt;  You cannot (and really should not) uninstall the &lt;em&gt;IAStorDataSvc&lt;/em&gt; driver, but the application has a lot of monitors and settings that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/windows-81-pro-high-cpu-usage-from-intel-process/9d89b9db-498f-4eec-9381-88a6937bd1b6&quot;&gt;known to cause high CPU usage&lt;/a&gt;.  I mean really, really high.  Uninstalling this application took my computer from &amp;quot;on fire&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;I can actually sit with my laptop in my lap&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uninstall your stash random unused applications.&lt;/strong&gt; You should be doing this regardless of upgrading to Windows 10, but upgrade day is always a good day to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clean up the list of applications and services that start up when you turn on your computer.&lt;/strong&gt;  Lots of applications like to hide in this list so that they are already running when you decide to use them.  The issue is when you have 10 or 20 (or more) of these applications, your computer just lags, both on startup and in general.  I use [CCleaner](&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;amp;ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwjw0uDWjYTHAhUBJR4KHTYODxM&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.piriform.com%2Fccleaner&amp;amp;amp;ei=b8C6VbDfKYHKeLacvJgB&amp;amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH5XNJpjkpcB0scHDcckUguUq9jYA&amp;amp;amp;sig2=Xyp0VFK-Gg_Fe15Zq8UjSw&amp;amp;amp;bvm=bv.99028883,bs.1,d.dmo%5C&quot;&gt;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;amp;ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwjw0uDWjYTHAhUBJR4KHTYODxM&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.piriform.com%2Fccleaner&amp;amp;amp;ei=b8C6VbDfKYHKeLacvJgB&amp;amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNH5XNJpjkpcB0scHDcckUguUq9jYA&amp;amp;amp;sig2=Xyp0VFK-Gg_Fe15Zq8UjSw&amp;amp;amp;bvm=bv.99028883,bs.1,d.dmo&#92;&lt;/a&gt;) to view and clean up, but there are lots of other applications that will help you out as well.  Just be sure you know what you are disabling on startup so that you do not disable something important.  When in doubt, Google the name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The start menu is amazing!&lt;/strong&gt;  You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.howtogeek.com/197836/8-ways-to-customize-the-windows-10-start-menu/&quot;&gt;customize this area to your heart&#39;s content&lt;/a&gt;. You can sort and order your start up pins and live tiles.  You can turn live tiles on and off.  (I recommend only having a couple live tiles on, especially if you have a slower computer.)  You can make the menu larger or smaller by dragging the top and right edges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having a Microsoft account seems to be required.&lt;/strong&gt;  Or, at least, strongly preferred.  This clearly stems from the fact that this OS is very mobile-focused.  (It has applications that will sync with your phone, read your texts, use touch events, etc.)  Great if you have a touch screen, but not exactly helpful on my 3-year old laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notifications like to kid with you.&lt;/strong&gt;  My notifications icon seems to always say that I have new notifications.  Even when I do not.  This appears to be a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New applications will take forever to start.&lt;/strong&gt;  At least, this is true for the first time you use a new application.  It is much better after subsequent uses.  Just be patient for that first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cortana seems fun.&lt;/strong&gt;  Like Siri &lt;em&gt;(yes, I am an iPhone user)&lt;/em&gt;, Cortana seems to be a fun feature, but since I do not usually talk to my laptop &lt;em&gt;(unless I am coding, but in that case, I really do not want it to answer back)&lt;/em&gt;, Cortana does not appear to be particularly useful in the laptop world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WAMPserver will not start up.&lt;/strong&gt;  Be warned if you happen to need an *AMP stack on your computer.  I am still working on this -- a [process that appears to require installing Microsoft Visual C++](&lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.wampserver.com/read.php?2,130348,130363%5C&quot;&gt;http://forum.wampserver.com/read.php?2,130348,130363&#92;&lt;/a&gt;) and one that I do not feel like doing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fonts in older applications will look weird and grainy.&lt;/strong&gt;  Newer applications look beautiful.  Older applications, not so much.  For some reason, the developers of Office 2010 and Quicken 2012 did not take Windows 10 into account.  Geez people.  But seriously, if you are using older applications, be prepared to either deal with them looking a little gross or upgrade if it really bothers you.  The plus side is that 95% of my applications seem to be completely functional after the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take advantage of the Microsoft store for utility apps.&lt;/strong&gt;  There are a lot of free apps in the store and I have definitely been taking advantage of that, from Adobe Photoshop Express to LastPass to Dropbox.  All applications I used before, but faster &lt;em&gt;(at least, after the first usage)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Virtual desktops have arrived!&lt;/strong&gt; They are functional and this totally just made my year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am really impressed with Windows 10.  At least, I am now that I have spent 24 hours tweaking my computer like mad.  Much of my need to tweak was the fact that I do have older applications on an older machine.  &lt;em&gt;(The fact that a 3-year old machine is &amp;quot;older&amp;quot; is a topic for another day.)&lt;/em&gt;  Not Microsoft&#39;s fault.  &lt;em&gt;(Did I really just say that?)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I am quite impressed that the OS works as well as it does.  None of my data was lost.  The vast majority of my applications work.  And I have found a slew of new, free apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, so good.  Let&#39;s hope it stays this way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Embracing the base: A little advice that developers might find surprising</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2015/07/embracing-the-base/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I spent some time interacting with candidates for a development job and peppering them with questions at a recruiting event. One candidate who had just started to learn to code finally asked me a question, which isn’t exactly common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you were to hire me, what is the one thing I should definitely learn?” he asked. It’s a question that’s actually broadly relevant to any developer entering the job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a development manager, I meet new developers all the time, and I am usually the one who asks them a whole round of questions: What programming languages do you know? What are your current projects? Is there anything new you’re learning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was refreshing to hear such a straightforward question from a job candidate, so I gave him an equally straightforward answer: Start with the basics. Learn JavaScript without using any libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was surprised. And this surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every other recruiter in the room told him to start with &lt;a href=&quot;http://jquery.com/&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://angularjs.org/&quot;&gt;Angular&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;. Or &lt;a href=&quot;https://emberjs.com/&quot;&gt;Ember&lt;/a&gt;. All of these are libraries or frameworks that extend JavaScript to make development easier and give web applications a structure. I was the first person suggest starting with nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that JavaScript developers no longer write in plain old JavaScript. Almost all apps and websites use some sort of library framework — from the ones suggested to my new developer friend to many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;jQuery is a popular example. It was first &lt;a href=&quot;https://jquery.org/history/&quot;&gt;released in 2006&lt;/a&gt; and is now used in about &lt;a href=&quot;https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/js-jquery&quot;&gt;64 percent of all websites&lt;/a&gt;. jQuery has become so synonymous with JavaScript and front-end development that a good number of resumes now list jQuery as a technical skill in place of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that these libraries — including jQuery, Prototype, or YUI — make JavaScript development a much easier task today. We can now more easily select elements, create click events, make AJAX calls, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is this such a good thing? Yes and no..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although more complex web applications might be suited for something like jQuery, what about sites that require just a little bit of JavaScript for key pieces of functionality? Is jQuery or another library really the right choice? Or, can the same functionality be accomplished with &lt;a href=&quot;http://plainjs.com/&quot;&gt;vanilla JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s true that vanilla JavaScript is not as sexy as jQuery. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;document.querySelectorAll(‘div.foo’) // native JS
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is not nearly as slick looking as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;$(‘div.foo’) // jQuery equivalent
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web community is finally discussing how &lt;a href=&quot;https://zurb.com/blog/hit-the-weights-and-take-the-bloat-out-of&quot;&gt;bloated&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sitepoint.com/do-you-really-need-jquery/&quot;&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitworking.org/news/2014/05/zero_framework_manifesto/&quot;&gt;frameworks&lt;/a&gt; are. So much so that, for jQuery users, Paul Irish released &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/paulirish/12fb951a8b893a454b32&quot;&gt;bling.js&lt;/a&gt; last month, which is a quick 15 lines of JavaScript that provides “the $ of jQuery without the jQuery”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend to learn libraries first — or only libraries — puts these new developers on an unsustainable path. All JavaScript libraries and frameworks are obviously based in JavaScript. But a beginner is not learning vanilla JavaScript when they dive into one or more of these libraries. Sure, learning JavaScript this way will demonstrate how to write a conditional or a loop. It will demonstrate how to declare variables and to write and call functions. But it will not demonstrate why the code works the way it does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a new developer, learn the basics of JavaScript — or any other new language — and learn about its libraries and frameworks. You need all of this knowledge. Knowing the frameworks will get you a job today, but having a solid understanding of JavaScript as a base language will let you keep your job tomorrow. New frameworks are introduced to our community all the time, and while one may be the “hot” framework that everyone wants right now, that will probably not be true five or even two years from now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important skill you can acquire is the the ability to know how today’s frameworks work under the hood, so that you can more quickly learn the frameworks of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I need a job!: 4 tips from a hiring manager</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2015/07/tips-from-a-hiring-manager/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The job market has been really fantastic for developers, so much so that technical immersion programs, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://generalassemb.ly/&quot;&gt;General Assembly&lt;/a&gt; and the Iron Yard, have become increasingly popular.  More developers than ever are entering the market, yet unemployment (at least in DC) is near zero (according to several local recruiters I have spoken to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a hiring manager, I have seen many amazing candidates and many less-than-amazing candidates.  I am sure (at least some of) the less than amazing ones are actually amazing.  Here are 4 pieces of advice for the amazing and aspiring-amazing job seekers out there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. For the love of all that is good in the world, your resume is not an auto-biography.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok.  Your resume really is an auto-biography of sorts, but it should not be as long as one.  If you are a developer, your resume should answer two basic questions: “Can you code?” and “Can you learn?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What answers these questions?  The languages you know.  Your portfolio – websites, modules, and libraries that you have worked on and can demonstrate.  How you stay current and learn new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is it.  I do not need to know your marital status.  Or your height and weight.  Or your date and place of birth.  Or the elementary, middle, and high schools you graduated from.  Or intricate details about your first retail job.  Or the grade that you got in that hand drumming class you took senior year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding length, if you are a relatively new developer with some experience, your resume should be one page.  Period.  If you are more senior, keep your resume down to two pages.  Maybe three if you have something super interesting to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, please save your 12-page resume for the outline of your memoir.  If it ends up in my inbox, it will find its way into my trash bin.  Even if you are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Please follow directions.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My company, like most companies, has a process that we follow when hiring new developers.  Part of that process includes a coding test that has specific instructions.  Write a web application that does &lt;em&gt;xyz&lt;/em&gt;.  Write the backend in PHP.  Make the front-end look like &lt;em&gt;such-and-such&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reasons behind the instructions because each instruction has a specific objective.  For example, the backend should be written in PHP because our team works with PHP-based CMSs.  Therefore, a candidate needs at minimum a basic understanding of PHP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sent this coding test to one particular candidate and received his app a couple of days later with a note: “I wrote this in Rails instead of PHP.  Will that be a problem?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Um… yes.  It is a problem.  To be fair, the code was actually pretty good.  However, it was not what I asked for and it did not answer the question I needed to be answered.  (i.e. Can this person code in PHP?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it did answer an equally important question: Can this candidate follow instructions and code based on project requirements.  (Hint: That answer is no.)  Needless to say, I did not hire him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Make sure your code works before sending it to me.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see a lot of work that simply doesn’t.  Portfolio links that are not responsive.  Portfolio links with broken links.  Coding tests that are missing half of the functionality that I had asked for.  I even once got a coding test back where the candidate asked me for help debugging the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your code is more important than your resume.  Seriously.  Clearly demonstrating that you can do the work through your portfolio or a coding exercise will make me hire you faster than seeing that you work for “Amazing Ninja Coding Warriors, Inc” or that you got a 4.0 in college studying computer science.  Even if the only work you show me is that coding test, make sure it works.  Make sure it looks amazing.  Make sure your code is clean.  Because that is your first impression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Give your social media presence a once-over.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know that everyone now has an online presence.  We all search for people online and you can be sure that I will be searching for you at some point during the interview process.  If I find you and see that your online life is full of… well… life (and good examples of your work), then yay!  If I don’t find you at all… well, I am not sure what that really says about you.  But if you are any sort of website professional, it is a little odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/google-doesnt-want-people-using-google-as-a-verb/&quot;&gt;google yourself&lt;/a&gt; and double-check what comes up.  Google recently made it even easier to check out your social media presence with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.social-searcher.com/google-social-search/&quot;&gt;Social Searcher&lt;/a&gt;.  This gives you a chance to take anything down that you might not want me to see (even though &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.educatorstechnology.com/2013/05/your-online-life-permanent-as-tattoo.html&quot;&gt;everything you post is permanent&lt;/a&gt;) and figure out just how searchable you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you have an online presence that is hard to find (I’m looking at you John Doe!), please do me a favor and send me a link or two to LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.  It will make my life easier and I will probably like you better for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>About this tech girl</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2015/04/about-this-tech-girl/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There have been a lot of stories in the news about gender issues in the tech world. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://slate.com/business/2015/03/ellen-pao-trial-the-lawsuit-brought-awareness-to-workplace-sexism-but-the-setbacks-are-gripping.html&quot;&gt;Ellen Pao case&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gawker.com/what-is-gamergate-and-why-an-explainer-for-non-geeks-1642909080&quot;&gt;Gamergate&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/a-dongle-joke-that-spiraled-way-out-of-control/&quot;&gt;dongle joke&lt;/a&gt; at Pycon.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/03/26/silicon-valley-gender-gap-widening/70444276/&quot;&gt;gender gap&lt;/a&gt; in the tech industry.  The list goes on and on. And now today, an LA Times article came out asking &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-women-tech-20150222-story.html&quot;&gt;why women are leaving the tech industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am 100% a woman and 100% a programmer.  And I am not going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the stories I have been reading about women in tech, many seem to have a sub-theme that we should be able to embrace our techie-ness &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; our girly-ness.  That it is OK to wear a dress and cute heels, putt makeup on, and fix up my hair.  That this will send a signal that it is OK to be girly and be a tech geek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; OK to be girly and be techie... as long as that is who you actually are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Un-Style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My style is really not.  I have (many, many) days I just want to wear yoga pants and and a tank top and call it good.  If it weren&#39;t for corporate dress codes, that outfit would happen way more often.  I also wear, and even (mostly) like, dresses.  But on those days, I also make jokes about how I&#39;m not wearing any pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t like spending that much time getting ready in the morning because, frankly, I have better things to do.  I don&#39;t wear makeup and my hair is always in a ponytail because it is easy.  And while I wear dresses, anyone will tell you that I will happily sit on the floor in that dress as long as I&#39;m pretty sure I won&#39;t flash someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first little kid crush was &lt;a href=&quot;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R2-D2&quot;&gt;not even human&lt;/a&gt;.  (That has not &lt;a href=&quot;https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/Tenth_Doctor&quot;&gt;changed much&lt;/a&gt; as an adult.) I would rather see a sci-fi movie than a romantic comedy.  Although to be honest, I would rather go to a football game than the movies.  I make crude jokes because, every so often, I have the sense of humor of a 13-year old.  I joke about having gone to a boys school because I basically did.  I am more comfortable around guys than I am around girls because I am blunt and (for the most part) so are they.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting back to coding.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started writing code when I was 7, despite the fact that I grew up in the &#39;80s and that was weird back then.  It was an Apple iiC and I quickly learned that turning it on without a disk would get me to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.landsnail.com/a2ref.htm&quot;&gt;BASIC prompt&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;(You always remember your first.)&lt;/em&gt;  One thing lead to another and now I have been coding professionally for over 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people take me seriously as a programmer, but I still come across some who get weirded out because I &amp;quot;don&#39;t look like a programmer.&amp;quot;  I look too nice or too put together or too girly.  As though, the programmer uniform somehow still consists of jeans, old t-shirts, mad scientist hair, and no breasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ignore those weirded out people because they don&#39;t fit into my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have pretty much constructed my life and career around what feels right.  Yes, that is a little hippie for a programmer, but it has worked well.  If a job feels right, I stay.  If not, I don&#39;t.  Same with people.  If a person feels right (friend or otherwise), we stay.  If not... sorry.  Life is too short to act otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So... who am I?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a woman.  I am a professional geek.  I am girly and not girly at the same time.  I am who I am, quirks and all, and I own every quirk that I have.  And every other geek/nerd/techie/whatever -- female or not -- should do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cleaner Gmail sent folder</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2015/01/cleaner-gmail-sent-folder/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just started a new job where all communication is managed via Google – e-mail, calendar, and chat.  This being my first intensive experience with Gmail, I quickly discovered that the sent folder will drive me crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain: I am a huge advocate of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mashable.com/2013/10/10/inbox-zero/&quot;&gt;inbox zero&lt;/a&gt;.  I even take it so far to include my sent box.  If something I send out cannot be categorized into a folder, it does not belong in my e-mail.  This makes Gmail’s sent box particularly annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gmail’s sent box is not a label like inbox or any other label you create.  “Sent Mail” is actually a filter of all e-mails that have your e-mail address in the “From” field.  This means that, even if you add a label to a sent e-mail, it remains in the sent box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to fix this is to create your own custom “Sent Mail” label.  Here is how I created mine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Gmail, click on the gear icon and click on “Settings”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the “Labels” tab.  Click on “hide” next to “Sent Mail” and uncheck “Show in IMAP”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new label called “_Sent Mail” (without the quotes), or something similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the “Filters” tab and click on “Create a new filter”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter your e-mail address in the “From” field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter “has:nouserlabels” (without the quotes) in the “Has the words” field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Optional) Check “Don’t include chats”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click “Create a filter with this search”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the next screen, check “Apply the label” and select the “_Sent Mail” label you created earlier.  Also check “Also apply filter to matching messages”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click “Create filter”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create more advanced folders and filters with this technique as well; check out Gmails documentation on &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en&quot;&gt;Advanced Search&lt;/a&gt; options.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Backbone: No more hash tags!</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2014/12/backbone-no-more-hash-tags/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is one of your Backbone.js pet-peeves the fact that all of your routes have to start with a hash tag? It was mine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, it finally became a problem when I had to integrate my Backbone app inside of a larger application… one that is not hash tag friendly. (The story behind this integration is a much longer one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I would have to write something custom… and then I discovered Backbone History’s “root” parameter. It took me quite a while to find documentation on it (oddly), but this definitely fixed my issue.  Here is how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. You do not have to change your router.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use the standard Backbone router:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;var myRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    &amp;quot;page-one&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;openPageOne&amp;quot;
  }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Update the instantiation of your Backbone History.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do have to add a couple of parameters to your Backbone History start in order for this to work.  The first is, of course, the &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; parameter.  This parameter defines the root path to your Backbone application.  This is normally set to “/”; however, in my experience, you will want to change it to something else (i.e. “/myapp/”).  I am not sure why, but leaving it set to its default was not working for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also (and this bit is important!), make sure that you do not include your domain in the route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other parameter you need to add is the &lt;em&gt;pushState&lt;/em&gt; parameter.  This parameter needs to be set to &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;Backbone.history.start({pushState: true, root: &#39;/myapp/&#39;});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Test!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URL of your page (in this example) should be: [DOMAIN]/myapp/page-one&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to write code: Kid edition</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2014/12/how-to-write-code-kid-edition/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was recently asked to do some research on how to teach an 8-year old about mobile app development.   This made me happy on a bunch of levels.  This kid is interested in something that is pretty complicated for adults.  &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; she’s a girl.  Not to go into gender issues here, but this fact made me even happier.  Women in STEM are still so grossly under-represented it is ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I digress….&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coding for kids!  I compiled this list for one person and thought… well… this is good information for everyone!  Even if you are an adult, these are some great sites to get starting with writing your first “Hello World”.  If you have no idea what I am talking about, you will find out very soon.  Trust me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://code.org/learn&quot;&gt;Code.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: They have a bunch of free tutorials online that are geared to kids (8+) and beginners.  They teach a basic programming language that will get her started on basic programming concepts like logic statements and loops. They also sponsor an &lt;a href=&quot;https://hourofcode.com/us&quot;&gt;Hour of Code&lt;/a&gt;, which is a world-wide, recurring event that is a one-hour introduction to computer science and coding.  Teachers can set up local live events.  You may want to ask your school if they have an event set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tynker.com/&quot;&gt;Tynker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This is like &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.org&quot;&gt;code.org&lt;/a&gt; (above) but it looks more kid friendly and is not free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scratch.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a really cool, graphic way of creating games and animations.  Sort of like Logo (from the 80s, it was the program with the turtle that you could program to move around the screen and draw things), but more fun and modern looking. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted&quot;&gt;get started right away&lt;/a&gt;; there are tips and instructions on the right-hand side of the page, so you can work through the instructions and create something right away.  They have a number of tutorials on the site too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeavengers.com/jr&quot;&gt;Code Avengers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This site is great for learning web development (HTML and CSS).  The level 1 courses for HTML/CSS and JavaScript are both free, but they do charge for the level 2 and 3 courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kano.me/us&quot;&gt;Kano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a kit that you can buy that let’s you assemble a (small, simple) computer yourself.  It uses a Raspberry Pi, so you can expand this pretty easily as well if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Reverting remote commits in Git</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2014/11/reverting-remote-git-commits/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a “git” of a problem this week.  &lt;em&gt;(Ha... see what I did there?)&lt;/em&gt; I committed a bunch of changes to a remote branch, merged them to master, and then needed to back out those changes.  &lt;em&gt;(Why this need occurred is another story for another time.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First, my git log&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is basically what my git log looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;383a84a (me) Bad commit 3
f9e5973 (me) Bad commit 2
ac971af (me) Bad commit 1
fe4366a (me) Commit I want to revert back to
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the plan was to revert back to &lt;strong&gt;fe4366a&lt;/strong&gt;, a.k.a. “Commit I want to revert back to”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What do I do now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first instinct was to use “git reset –hard fe4366a”.  However, the problem with this command is that it only reset my working directory back to that “good” commit.  No changes to the branch were made, so I have nothing to push back up to the remote server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solution!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git checkout to the rescue!  Seriously.  Here’s what I did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Create a new branch (based off of master) for my reversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;git checkout -b my-new-branch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Checkout my last good commit to the new branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;git checkout fe4366a .
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; At this point, all of the files that were modified in the 3 bad commits have been modified again locally, to match the version in the “Commit I want to revert back to”.  Sanity check this just to be sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;git status
git diff
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; After confirming that the reverted changes look OK, commit the changes to the branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-powershell&quot;&gt;git commit -m &amp;quot;Reverting changes!&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done!  At this point, &lt;strong&gt;my-new-branch&lt;/strong&gt; can be merged back up to master or you can do whatever you want with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Give credit where credit is due.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114095/how-do-i-revert-a-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit&quot;&gt;solution on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, because that website is awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few other suggestions on how to revert commits in Git in the answers on that page.  The one I have outlined above was the one that worked best for my situation.  YMMV.  Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Talking to clients about mobile</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2014/10/talking-to-clients-about-mobile/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently moderated a discussion with UX designers and developers that focused on “adaptive” vs “responsive” websites and how to talk to clients about these terms.  We started out by establishing common definitions for each term:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An &lt;strong&gt;adaptive web site&lt;/strong&gt; is one that has set break points and “snaps” when transitioning from one break point to the next.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;responsive web site&lt;/strong&gt; is more fluid. It does not have set break points, so it flows as the screen size changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remainder of the discussion went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How should we define these terms in a statement of work?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yeah… um.  Don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;But... but...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No really.  Don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue is that everyone has different definitions of “adaptive” and “responsive”. These words have become buzz words that clients have heard and want to address, but most have different impressions of what they actually mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some agree with the definitions above. Some don’t. Some think that the two are terms for the same exact thing. Most seem to think that they are just code for “My site needs to be mobile because mobile is a thing now and everyone is mobile. Mobile!!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, these terms are often misused and thrown around without any understanding of the work involved. When a client says they want an adaptive site or a responsive site, they probably do not mean exactly that. It is our job as UX professionals to figure how what the client actually wants – minus the buzz words. This should be a discussion, not a line item in an SOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, what should we do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that we should assume that every project will have a mobile component.  To define what this mobile component will actually be, we need more information from the client:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does adaptive or responsive mean to you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the business objectives for your new site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the usage patterns of your current site per device?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you want to manage your new site? (i.e. marketing blocks, copy, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ok, chat with client… check! Now what?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design and architect!  This involves designers and developers working together to meet a client’s needs.  Rapid prototyping can definitely help with this process, but first we need to define a UX architecture that takes many things into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screen size is, of course, important, but so is device interaction. We also need to think about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;image performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;interactions on touch enabled devices vs. mice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;general performance: what is the device speed? connection speed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these problems needs to be tackled separately, some very likely with the help of the tech dev side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;That was a lot. We’re done now, right?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cute. Not even close.  Mobile is an iceberg.  This is just the tip.  I definitely do not have all of the answers.  But this discussion was absolutely a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adventures in IE: A story of JavaScript dependencies</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2014/06/adventures-in-ie/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have never really been one for developing in IE. To be honest, I usually exclusively develop using Chrome and save my cross-browser testing for the end of the project. This is very likely a debatable practice, and I may write a blog article about that in the future, but that is not why I am writing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just came across the weirdest IE bug I think I have every seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been working on a Backbone / Marionette web application for a client that utilizes Mockjax (for now) to simulate my REST calls to the backend service and Require to load all of my JS dependencies.  Mockjax obviously deals with JSON objects and therefore needs to stringify them, namely in its parse function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this works in Chrome.  It works in Firefox.  However, IE?  JSON is undefined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first I thought that I was having a load issue in IE and that I needed to be more specific about dependencies in my Require file.  I thought I was being fairly complete, but hey, you never know.  After experimenting with my Require file, I hit up Google and discovered this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta http-equiv=&amp;quot;X-UA-Compatible&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;IE=EDGE&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added it to the top of my HTML file and voila!  Problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Yay!... but what is this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had really never heard of X-UA-Compatible before today.  It is great that it solved my problem, but what on earth is it?  I consulted Google again and learned that this meta tag allows developers to specify in what version of IE a web page should be rendered.  Basically, it allows users to upgrade their browsers and developers to not necessarily upgrade their websites (i.e. to use modern standards that more recent versions of IE now – finally – support).  Ok, that is the mildly cynical definition of this tag, but even still, it is a pretty neat trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting this meta tag’s content to “IE=EDGE” tells IE to render the version using the highest version of the browser available to it.  So, a user who has IE 8 installed will always render my page using the IE 8 engine.  IE 9 will always render my page using the IE 9 engine.  And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good to know… so why do I need this tag?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team and I have been specifically developing our application to be standards compliant.  That is actually one of the primary directives of this project.  Therefore, I want IE to render my page using the most recent engine available to it.  And I am testing on IE 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My current theory is that IE by default prioritizes its compatibility mode over using the most recent engine available to it.  I have no idea why.  However, setting this tag to IE=EDGE overrides IE’s compatibility mode and forces it to always use the most recent engine.  In my case, IE 11, which supports JSON.  (Engines below IE 8 do not support JSON, which, in compatibility mode appears to be my issue.  At least, that is the working theory.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More info about this tag&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>30 things I learned after moving to DC</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2014/03/things-i-learned-after-moving-to-dc/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I moved from Boston to Washington DC in the summer of 2012. It was somewhat (mostly) random move, but one that was completely necessary for me. I recently came across a blog post by another transplant to DC -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://thoughtcatalog.com/brett-nolan/2014/03/24-things-ive-learned-after-moving-to-washington-dc/&quot;&gt;24 Things I&#39;ve Learned After Moving to Washington DC&lt;/a&gt; -- and was inspired to create a list of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DC is more than just DC, especially when you are talking to someone who doesn&#39;t live here.  I have literally heard conversations such as, &amp;quot;I&#39;m from DC!&amp;quot;.. &amp;quot;Oh, what part of DC?&amp;quot; .. &amp;quot;Falls Church&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any amount of snow is cause for panic.  Even saying the word snow will cause the area to shut down -- government and businesses alike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The roads after 2 inches of snow in DC are 10 times worse than the roads after 2 feet of snow in New England.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The humidity of a DC summer is unlike anything I have ever experienced... ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DC is under an hour away from some amazing Virginia wineries.  Seriously, the wine is so good, I have actually started to like red wine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is so much variety in terms of restaurants.  What started as a completely overwhelming number of choices has quickly turned awesome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of restaurants, there are so many amazing and delicious local restaurants and pubs here, that there is really no reason to go to a chain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brunch is totally a thing in DC and it is absolutely delicious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Happy hours are also a huge thing here and they make going out after work actually affordable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can buy alcohol in grocery stores and CVS in Virginia, but not in Maryland.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Driving is often the most efficient and often the only feasible way to get from point A to point B, especially if one of these points is in Georgetown or outside the District.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first thing someone will ask you is &amp;quot;What do you do for a living?&amp;quot;  If someone is a government contractor, they will rarely elaborate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-profits are a huge industry here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding someone who does not work for the government or a non-profit is rare and sometimes met with surprise.  If two private industry people randomly meet, it is considered a minor miracle and they instantly bond over this fact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether DC is part of the North or part of the South is completely up for debate.  Coming from the North, calling the DC area the South can produce some pretty comical results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a weird rivalry between people from Virginia and people from Maryland, but as far as I can tell, no one seems to know why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many, many running and bike trails in the area.  As a runner, I love this.  There is even one that goes right by Reagan National.  If you are new to that particular trail that goes by Reagan, you will absolutely duck when a plane comes in to land.  It is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; close.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of running, there are races of all distances and themes all the time.  &lt;em&gt;All the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking up the Metro escalators is a legit workout.  Especially at Dupont Circle.  Bonus points for running up the Metro escalators.  &lt;em&gt;Especially&lt;/em&gt; at Dupont Circle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The music scene in DC is fantastic!  There are a ton of great venues and listening rooms in the area and lots of them have shows every night.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are into folk or singer/songwriters, house concerts are a huge thing here.  They are all about an hour away in Maryland, but totally worth the drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic happens frequently and randomly.  Even at midnight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigating the Beltway is an art.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Construction, be it road or building, is a norm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; look up the Metro status before leaving the house.  Especially on weekends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of public transportation, every town has its own bus system and, so far, I have yet to find anyone who knows how they work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Football is &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; here.  Fandom in DC could rival that of Boston.  And despite the huge &lt;em&gt;(obviously)&lt;/em&gt; Redskins following here, there are a couple of Boston-friendly bars in the area that will show Sox and Pats games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finding someone who is actually from DC is rare.  So rare, that lots and lots of meetups and social networking groups exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enough people freelance and/or work remotely here, that co-working groups and spaces (both formal and informal ones) are everywhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DC is far enough south that year-round farmers markets are relatively abundant.  And delicious.  I recommend the one on Saturdays in Falls Church.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Hybris: Create components manually</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/07/hybris-create-components-manually/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have spent a large part of this year working in a system called Hybris, which is a Java-based e-commerce platform.  The Hybris back-end seems to be very robust and includes a decent amount of documentation.  The Hybris front-end also seems to be very robust, but it is not the most user-friendly thing on the planet and includes very little documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me sad.  To be fair, the folks at Hybris are seriously stepping up and working more on the front-end UI and documentation, but, for right now, we are not quite there yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the big features of Hybris is its use of IMPEX files to add content slots and components &lt;em&gt;(or, content that is added to content slots)&lt;/em&gt; to all of the different pages of your website.  IMPEX files are basically files that contain pared down and somewhat weirdly-formatted SQL statements that insert information about components and content slots into the content catalog database.  Users &lt;em&gt;(i.e. site administrators)&lt;/em&gt; can always add content using the UI in the CMS cockpit.  The IMPEX files are really just used to define a base set of content for the site that is rolled out on site launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is a very powerful part of a UX developer&#39;s experience in Hybris.  Sadly, it is not very well documented &lt;em&gt;(at least, as of right now)&lt;/em&gt;.  So, I wrote documentation.  It is linked below in PDF form &lt;em&gt;(because it is 10+ pages long)&lt;/em&gt;.  Having these notes have helped me learn more about how to deal with IMPEX files and Hybris.  My hope is that it will help other UX developers too.  Enjoy &lt;em&gt;(and good luck)&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mobile should not be an afterthought</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/07/mobile-should-not-be-an-afterthought/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I grew up watching the Jetsons, with their flying cars and video calls, and Star Trek, with their tricorders and communicators.  Looking back at these shows, there is a common theme here.  Sometime in the future, we could have technology that connects people over thousands – or even millions – of miles.  Pretty cool right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was all back in… well… a while ago.  We are now in 2013, and this is “sometime in the future”.  We have mobile phones and tablets and smart watches.  We can connect with people who are anywhere in the world, from anywhere in the world.  We connect in real time through phone calls, Skype, Facebook, Twitter and too many other services to list here.  We also connect to information about people and businesses at any time through websites and apps on our phones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, why are there still businesses out there who ignore mobile?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps “ignore” is not the right word, but there are a number of business websites out there that have clearly not given that much thought about their mobile experience.  Why?  I have no idea.  However, speaking as a user experience developer, these businesses need to join the rest of us in this decade.  In an age where &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.internetretailer.com/2013/01/09/nearly-quarter-web-traffic-mobile&quot;&gt;nearly a quarter of web traffic is mobile&lt;/a&gt;, we need to start living in reality.  Mobile web is not a fad.  This statistic is only going to increase and businesses need to be ready for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile users expect expect the same level of content and functionality as their desktop user counterparts.  At the same time, the mobile experience is inherently different from the desktop experience.  As a result, this mobile experience needs to be planned and distinct.  Why, you ask?  Here are 2 big reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mobile devices are smaller.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No kidding, right?  But consider this.  We, as UX professionals, have always carefully designed desktop sites to make sure all of the important parts are “above the fold”.  The fold is more ambiguous now with all of the mobile devices on the market, but the philosophy is still the same.  The most important content for a mobile user needs to be at the top of a mobile site – and what is important to a mobile user may very well be different than what is important to a desktop user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mobile devices have limited bandwidth.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our desktop websites, we can pretty much assume that users have modern computers that are connected via some sort of high speed connection.  These users can download a lot of data in a really short amount of time.  Fantastic for them, but this, unfortunately, has made many web developers lazy in terms of optimizing the file sizes of our UX elements.  While our desktop users will probably never really notice this, our mobile users certainly will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it.  You want to go to a website on your 4G phone with your 2GB data plan &lt;em&gt;(because, face it, unlimited data plans are a thing of the past for most of us)&lt;/em&gt;, and the website is taking forever to load because it was not optimized for mobile and is now downloading a couple MBs of images and code.  I do not know about you, but I am not a patient soul.  I will move on and go visit someone else’s website.  If this were a business, they most likely just lost my sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, what do mobile users expect?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosophy a couple of years ago was to deliver a simple, pared down version of a site’s desktop experience to mobile users.  However, with mobile traffic on the rise – remember, it is almost at 25% now… and growing – mobile users are expecting more from their phones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already established that mobile users want to do and see everything that is available to their desktop user counterparts, but this functionality needs to be optimized for mobile devices.  Whether this happens via a responsive website or a separate mobile website is a debate for another article, but this optimization needs to exist.  Let me repeat that.  A mobile experience needs to be &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;optimized&lt;/strong&gt;.  In today’s world, this is a requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does optimized mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mobile sites need to be easily navigable.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, content needs to be organized based on level of importance to a mobile user.  However, attention also has to be paid to the site’s navigation.  What are the most important sections of the site?  What links are clicked on most often by mobile users.  &lt;em&gt;(Hint: Look at your site analytics!)&lt;/em&gt;  I will not go into detail on navigation in this post, but consider this.  A mobile site has limited real estate for navigation and, potentially, a large amount of content to organize and link to.  Also, as a bonus, users cannot hover on a link on a mobile device, like they can on a desktop site to view a drop-down menu.  &lt;em&gt;(For more information, there is a comprehensive article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/web/complex-navigation-patterns-for-responsive-design/&quot;&gt;complex navigation patterns for responsive design&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Files for mobile sites need to be smaller.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minify the CSS and JavaScript files.  Optimize the HTML.  And please, oh please, do not load giant full sized images.  While you may have a beautiful, hi-res version of a feature photo, mobile users do not care.  Shrink the image down and load a mobile-friendly image via a CSS media query.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Input fields are not created equal.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to optimize forms on a mobile device is to correctly define your input types based on the data you are expecting.  There are quite a number of input types that display optimized keyboards for that type.  An input for a credit card field should bring up a number keyboard.  An input for an e-mail address should bring up the e-mail keyboard.  There is a great reference online that lists out all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mobileinputtypes.com/&quot;&gt;mobile input types&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile development done correctly takes a lot of time and effort, but if you as a company want to reach those users and make them happy, it is worth it.  Do not leave your mobile development to the last minute.  Plan out your mobile strategy alongside your desktop strategy.  Design the mobile and desktop sites simultaneously, or arguably better yet, design your mobile site first.  But do not ignore your mobile site.  Please and thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taming my Frankenstein monster of a website</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/05/taming-my-frankenstein-monster-of-a-website/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a disaster. My website, that is. I started my site with good intentions. All I wanted was a simple site with some basic information about me. Maybe my resume, too. After all, any serious web developer needs a website. So, I created my simple, static website and published it using Fastmail&#39;s file services. I was already using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fastmail.com/&quot;&gt;Fastmail&lt;/a&gt; for my e-mail and using a single service for my online needs was completely logical at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Then things got complicated...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, I decided that I wanted to publish my photos to my website.  I love taking pictures and have a ton of digital photos dating back to the days when I used film and a scanner.  I started out using a home-grown photo gallery, but that was quickly becoming a pain to maintain.  Fastmail does not offer any advanced server support, so adding a more dynamic photo gallery on their servers was out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I discovered a miracle feature in Fastmail... the photo gallery.  I don’t remember the year I made this discovery, but it had to have been around 2005 or 2006.  I loved it – all I needed to do was upload my photos to a folder and… bam!  Instant photo gallery.  Upload a CSS file to that folder and suddenly my photo album had the same UI as the rest of my website.  Easy solution with no need to migrate my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, I decided I wanted a blog. Why? Because blogging is cool. Everyone is doing it and I wanted in. So, I started a blog on LiveJournal (remember that?) and eventually migrated it to WordPress.  I wanted to link my website and my blog together, but that seemed to be easier said than done.  I cannot install WordPress on Fastmail&#39;s servers and migrating my photo gallery, which at that point had become quite extensive, into a WordPress install would have taken a significant amount of effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I took one look at my website analytics &lt;em&gt;(thank you Google)&lt;/em&gt; and decided that integrating the two sites was not worth the effort at the time.  I experimented with different themes in WordPress to try to get it to match my main website, but it never felt quite right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oh my goodness... what am I doing here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not happy with the Frankenstein-esque nature that my website has now taken.  My static pages lived at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jhalabi.com&quot;&gt;www.jhalabi.com&lt;/a&gt;, which I considered to be my core site.  My photo gallery, which granted, was on the same server as my core site, had to live under its own sub-domain for the gallery to work properly.  My blog lived on &lt;a href=&quot;http://WordPress.com&quot;&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did I get here?  Two words.  Scope creep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those dreaded words are the bane of all web developers’ professional lives.  We have to mitigate this with our clients all the time.  I have zero explanation as to how I let myself to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I need a solution... stat!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, after years of allowing my monster website to live on, I decided that this was the year to make things right.  I wanted one website on one host using one platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing a platform was the easy part.  Granted, there are a lot of platforms out there.  I had worked with WordPress and Drupal before.  Joomla is a popular choice too.  Plus there are a whole slew of smaller CMS platforms out there.  (Perch looks like a cute one – and not just because of the birdie on their website. Well, maybe a little because of that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose WordPress because it felt right for me.  It is open source, easy to use, and built on PHP (which is my comfort zone).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building this puppy… and making it responsive.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the design of my existing core website &lt;em&gt;(where my core pages live)&lt;/em&gt;.  In addition, my existing website was responsive, so I wanted my upgraded website to be responsive too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made migrating my CSS from my old site to my new WordPress theme relatively painless.  Yes, I did need to edit the CSS quite a bit to work with the DOM in the WordPress templates, but overall, this was not a bad process at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My static pages from the old site became pages in the WordPress site.  I was able to export my blog posts from &lt;a href=&quot;http://WordPress.com&quot;&gt;WordPress.com&lt;/a&gt; into my new site easily too.  (There is a great &lt;a href=&quot;https://problogger.com/how-to-move-from-wordpresscom-to-wordpressorg/&quot;&gt;blog post with instructions&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tricky part was my photo gallery.  Photo galleries are not exactly out-of-the-box functionality in WordPress.  After some trial and error with a couple of different plugins, I found the perfect one for my needs – &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/&quot;&gt;NextGen Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.  NextGen gives me a separate area in the WP admin where I can upload photos and organize them into galleries and albums – a paradigm I was using on my existing site.  Photos are placed into galleries and galleries are organized into albums.  This allowed me to organize all of my galleries into albums by year.  Perfect!  And crazy easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, web hosting.  After a 10-ish year relationship with Fastmail being my web host, I had to finally admit to myself that I outgrew it.  Fastmail is a fantastic host for simple, static website, but sadly, it is not even possible for WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I discovered that GoDaddy offers free web hosting for customers who registered their domains with them.  And guess where I registered &lt;a href=&quot;http://jhalabi.com&quot;&gt;jhalabi.com&lt;/a&gt;… GoDaddy!  GoDaddy’s free service has a wizard that can be used to install WordPress, but that was completely broken for me.  I just uploaded the WP download to my server space and manually installed the platform.  After that, I uploaded my theme directory, imported my database and my website was live!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analytics on my website really did not justify the need for me to re-platform my website like this, but I got to a point where I no longer cared.  That crazy monster website had been bothering me for way too long and it was definitely time for a change. And I feel so much better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still on the fence about GoDaddy as a web host.  Administering my website is a snap there, but the server speeds vary a lot.  I am not sure if this is because I am using a free account here.  I have been considering upgrading to a paid account, but need more information to make sure it will help with the speed issues before I spend any money on it.  (Advice appreciated here!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am definitely a fan of WordPress and a definitely a fan of NextGen.  Seriously – that plugin saved me a lot of heartache.  Is it right for you?  Maybe!  I cannot tell you that.  This post is really a summary of my own experiences with re-platforming my website.  However keep in mind that all of the decisions I made here were right for me.  What is right for me and right for you may be two different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, check out NextGen.  Oh yeah, and the rest of my website.  Because it is seriously awesome now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>February photo a day, day 28</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/02/february-photo-a-day-day-28/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;And last but not least... the 28th!  Today&#39;s photo subject was &amp;quot;upside down&amp;quot;, which gave me a great excuse to hang around... well... upside down.  Seeing my office upside down was the most fun.  My apartment does not have a whole lot of storage space, but it has high ceilings.  So to help with office storage, I built up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The photo subject for the 27th: &amp;quot;playing&amp;quot;.  Now, I don&#39;t really play that often.  At least, not the way I think of playing.  It has been forever since I jumped rope... or played hopscotch... or tag... or make believe with dolls.  (Ignore the fact that my house is littered with stuffed animals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, one of my goals for this year is to re-learn how to play the piano.  I used to play... badly... a long time ago.  Teaching myself this time around has been easier than I thought it would be... and crazy fun.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/02/february-photo-a-day-day-26/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The photo subject for the today was &amp;quot;quiet&amp;quot;.  Taking a picture of actual quiet stumped me at first.  What is quiet?  Especially in my life.  I like background noise.  A lot.  TV, music, podcasts, whatever.  I am a city girl, so.. well.. my neighborhood is not all that quiet.  And I am terrible at meditating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at the gym when I found the inspiration for today&#39;s photo: my headphones.  They are both loud and quiet -- loud in my ears &lt;em&gt;(don&#39;t worry... not too loud)&lt;/em&gt;, but quiet for everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who knew this photo-a-day thing would get so personal?  OK- that is somewhat of a no-brainer, right?   Why do I ask?  Because today&#39;s photo subject was &amp;quot;on my bedside table&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, internet readers: meet Baby.  I have had her literally forever.  She survived my childhood and she survived my 20-some-odd moves since then.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/02/february-photo-a-day-day-24/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, another apology.  Today&#39;s photo subject was &amp;quot;cloud&amp;quot;.  All I could think of when I saw this subject was a photo I took in Chicago several years ago.  I was out there for a family reunion.  It was an absolutely gorgeous August day and we all went for a walk.  I really can&#39;t remember exactly where we were. It was in one of the western suburbs. We were walking along a trail when we came upon a lake.  This is where I took the photo that I am posting for today&#39;s &amp;quot;photo-a-day&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is where my apology comes in.  I know this challenge is really for me to actually &lt;em&gt;take&lt;/em&gt; a photo each day, not just post a random photo, but I could not get this one out of my head.  The clouds in the sky were those big, fluffy ones, and I was able to get both the clouds and their reflection in the lake.  There is no way I could take something that cool today.  I am not even convinced this is something I could plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So... here you go!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A little behind again, but hey -- it was a weekend.  Saturday&#39;s photo subject was &amp;quot;word&amp;quot;.   So, I spent all day with my camera, taking pictures of words wherever I went.  Which was weird.  I did take other pictures too!  But going from taking a photo of a gorgeous landscape &lt;em&gt;(I was in the middle of VA wine country on Saturday)&lt;/em&gt; to taking a picture of a single word on a sign is... well... a little strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the word that I found actually came later that night, when I went to a concert at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.themusicloftonline.com/&quot;&gt;The Music Loft&lt;/a&gt; in Herndon to see &lt;a href=&quot;https://wrecklessericamyrigby.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;Wreckless Eric and Amy Rigby&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;em&gt;(Good show!)&lt;/em&gt; The word -- &amp;quot;working&amp;quot; -- just seemed appropriate given the month I have had at work. &lt;em&gt;(The sign was actually announcing the duo&#39;s latest album.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Work has been hard lately.  I mean seriously, frustratingly hard.  I am learning a new piece of tech these days, which is pretty awesome, but, at the same time, obnoxiously crazy and seemingly impossible.  The learning curve is getting better, but it has been a long time coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Times like these are the ones where I really miss the basics of web development.  Getting a comp.  Opening a blank text editor.  Writing CSS until the site looks pretty.  That just makes me happy... in a really dorky way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s photo subject is &amp;quot;makes me smile&amp;quot;.  And today -- well, this week really -- I have finally had an opportunity to sit down in front of my little text editor and write CSS code for a few hours. &lt;em&gt;(OK... technically I am writing LESS code and compiling it to CSS, which is so much more awesome, but that&#39;s not the point here.)&lt;/em&gt; This totally made me smile.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s photo subject was &amp;quot;full&amp;quot;.  Today was also a crazy busy day at work &lt;em&gt;(from home)&lt;/em&gt;, so I needed to find something &amp;quot;full&amp;quot; around my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a while, but I did find something: my sock drawer.  Sounds silly and ridiculous, but I am constantly going through socks.  I lose socks. I wear through socks.  I layer socks.  Seriously. If it is cold out, I will wear 3 pairs of socks at once.  So, I have a lot of socks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been falling a little behind in my photo taking again, so here I am, working on two photo posts at once.  Yesterday&#39;s photo subject was &amp;quot;where I stood&amp;quot;.  Since it is tax season and the end of winter, I have been doing a little bit of organizing and cleaning around the apartment &lt;em&gt;(more-so than usual, that is)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new apartment does not have a whole lot of storage space, but it does have really high ceilings, so I have been building up -- shelves built up on top of other shelves, etc.  It is a little crazy looking, but it gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s photo subject is &amp;quot;I am....&amp;quot;  I decided to take this opportunity to take a self portrait.  Probably cliche, but I have been meeting to change up my Facebook profile picture anyway, so why not?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a fantastic weekend.  So fantastic, that I just found the time to work on yesterday&#39;s photo of the day.  Typical I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What made this even funnier was yesterday&#39;s photo subject: something I don&#39;t like.  After an awesome weekend filled with (mostly) positive things, I have to think about something I don&#39;t like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oddly, that came to me easier today.  After a long weekend filled with music, friends, and several late nights, my body decided to rebel.  Yes... I got sick.  So, my dear reader, I present to you something I definitely do not like right now -- not because it is not helping me immensely, but because I actually need it right now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend has officially been my concert-going marathon weekend.  Four concerts.  Five days.  Last night was another Eddie from Ohio concert at the Birchmere.  And yesterday&#39;s photo subject was &amp;quot;in your hand&amp;quot;.  It just felt right to take a picture of my concert ticket for this photo.  Another great show!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>February photo a day, day 16</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/02/february-photo-a-day-day-16/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you probably read a couple of days ago, I have started to take some liberties with this photo-a-day challenge.  Today &lt;em&gt;(or, rather yesterday at this point)&lt;/em&gt; is another one of those liberties.  Don&#39;t worry. I did take a picture this time.  But there&#39;s a (long) story to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo subject for the 16th was &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot;.  Now, on paper, my day yesterday was pretty darn awesome.  However, I have been dealing with some things lately that have been bringing up more questions than answers, and are making me feel far less than perfect.  So, thinking about perfection is pretty hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short about my day yesterday: One of my favorite bands, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eddiefromohio.com&quot;&gt;Eddie From Ohio&lt;/a&gt;, is playing their annual 3-night concert series at the Birchmere.  Awesome.  Seriously.  I have been looking forward to this weekend for a while.  As in, since last year.  Local friends come out of the word work.  Not-so-local friends come out too.  It&#39;s like a big reunion.  With music.  Really kick-ass music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I took pictures.  Lots of pictures.  The Birchmere is a fantastic place for both listening to music and photographing bands.  (Their stage lights seriously make me happy.  I am a dork.)  However, despite the fact that I took some pretty awesome pictures of a fantastic night, I am still struggling with &amp;quot;perfect&amp;quot; here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One (other) cool thing about the Birchmere is that there is stuff everywhere.  Photos of artists who played there.  Calendars of shows from years past.  One stood out: January 2009.  EFO played the weekend before President Obama&#39;s first inauguration.  I came down for the inauguration &lt;em&gt;(sleeping on some random woman&#39;s floor that weekend a la Craigslist; hotels were completely booked!)&lt;/em&gt; and was able to catch a couple of the EFO shows while I was here.  That weekend was my first Birchmere experience.  Seeing that calendar was pretty perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And we&#39;re back!  Today&#39;s photo subject is &amp;quot;inside your fridge&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am 99% positive what is inside &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; fridge is more interesting than what is inside my fridge.  I am single, I have no roommates, and I hate to cook.  So... my fridge is basically condiments, some produce, and a lot of bagels.  (FYI: my freezer is much more interesting.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, assuming I have a following here, you have been following my photo-a-day journey for just about 2 whole weeks.  That is amazing - that both I am still taking pictures and you are still looking at them.  So... thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sorry to say that I am skipping #14.  It is not out of laziness or boredom, and I still completely plan to finish out this month of picture taking.  However, I just cannot do today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is February 14.  Valentine&#39;s Day.  Today&#39;s photo subject is &amp;quot;love is...&amp;quot;.   I am single, and my feelings about the matter are... well... complicated.  Too complicated.  I don&#39;t really want to think about it.  What love means to me and where my heart is at right now is breaking me, and I have neither the creativity nor the desire right now to try to take a picture of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps next year, but in the meantime, there will be more photos... tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s lucky photo subject was &amp;quot;walking&amp;quot;.  Sadly, I completely forgot about it until I got home tonight... after dark... in the rain.  I went for a walk around my complex.  Looking around my neighborhood, I realized it is not a particularly inspiring or visually interesting area.  So, instead, I decided to look down.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a really bad day today.  I had some conversations that verged on the completely ridiculous, which made my day... well... ridiculous.  How do I cope?  I baked!  In my office!  Well... home office.  This telecommuting thing can be kind of awesome sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cookies are my go-to baking project of choice.  Oatmeal chocolate chip cookies are my comfort food cookies.  Or, in today&#39;s case, comfort food lunch.  And guess what today&#39;s photo subject is.  Where I had lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healthiest lunch ever?  Not so much.  Soul healing lunch of the day?  Oh yeah!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/12-feb-where-i-ate-lunch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;February 12: Where I Ate Lunch&quot; :width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Disclaimer: Feel free to bake this at home, but not every day.  Or if you do, go for a run.  Life is all about balance.  Oh, and don&#39;t burn your kitchen down while you are on your baking spree. Baking more cookies is hard when your kitchen no longer exists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s photo subject is &amp;quot;entrance&amp;quot;.  Now, I really did not want to take a picture of a door, because that felt really boring and obvious.  However, how else do you really enter a space?  It is through a door or an archway or some other separator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK. Entrance equals door, basically.  This all got me thinking, what if you don&#39;t really know what is beyond the entrance?  Or, what if you just want to check out what is beyond the entrance without really committing to going through?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that I work from home and really do not have the time to go out and explore unfamiliar entrances in my neighborhood &lt;em&gt;(and believe me -- there are plenty here)&lt;/em&gt;, I decided to try to recreate this scenario of unfamiliar entrances in my very familiar home.  This is what I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am having the world&#39;s laziest Sunday.  I woke up after 10:00 this morning.  I have spent most of the day on my couch.  I did work on my website a little and take some pictures, but I have never really considered that to be work.  I spent a good chunk of the afternoon reading.  And I am still in my pjs.  It has been glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day nine&#39;s photo subject was &amp;quot;guilty pleasure&amp;quot;.  The dictionary defines a guilty pleasure as something you do that brings you joy, but you feel guilt about doing.  This is probably going to sound like a cliche... or a lie... but I do not really do things that make me happy &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; that I am embarrassed about.  However, I did think of one thing that I do - or rather eat - that makes me happy but I probably should not have quite so often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chocolate is awesome.  It makes me happy.  And I am not ashamed of it.  Well... except perhaps the fact that right now I am eating Hershey&#39;s chocolate.  Still awesome... but there is definitely better chocolate out there.  &lt;em&gt;(I miss Switzerland.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>February photo a day, day 8</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/02/february-photo-a-day-day-8/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s photo was really hard... at least at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day 8 photo subject was &amp;quot;something orange&amp;quot;.  Now, I really don&#39;t like orange.  I mean &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;.  don&#39;t.  like.  orange.  I have no orange clothes.  I have no orange furniture.  I don&#39;t even have oranges in my kitchen.  On top of it all, it is winter.  There is nothing orange outside either.  No turning leaves.  No orange flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was at a complete loss until I started looking through my bookshelves.  And then I found it.  My book of Winnie the Pooh stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tigger.  Duh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has known me for a while knows that I love Tigger.  College friends will remember a certain Tigger sweatshirt I wore often. &lt;em&gt;(Oh yeah... I was cool!)&lt;/em&gt; I have countless plush Tiggers all over the place.  You would think I would have thought about Tigger sooner.  But no.  I think Tigger is disappointed in me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>February photo a day, day 7</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/02/february-photo-a-day-day-7/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to day 7!  I have been doing this photo-a-day thing for a whole week... can you believe it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, today&#39;s photo subject is &amp;quot;your name&amp;quot;.  I actually had several ideas in mind for today&#39;s pic.  Grabbing a Joni Mitchell CD cover.  Taking a picture of my e-mail signature.  Finding those Winnie the Pooh letter figurines that my mom gave me years ago that spell out my name.  Digging out a personalized Christmas ornament.  Writing my name on a post-it  note.  And then I got hungry....&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>February photo a day, day 6</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/02/february-photo-a-day-day-6/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The day 6 photo subject was &amp;quot;soft&amp;quot;.   Now, I am a stuffed animal addict and have them &lt;em&gt;all over&lt;/em&gt; my apartment.  Seriously.  On my bed.  On my night stand.  In a basket in the corner.  On my living room end table.  For a while, on my dining room table.  &lt;em&gt;(I later decided that was a little excessive.)&lt;/em&gt;  So, my subject matter for today&#39;s photo was immediately obvious for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>February photo a day, day 5</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/02/february-photo-a-day-day-5/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, this story is a little gross.  Day 5&#39;s photo subject was &amp;quot;something you smelled&amp;quot;.  I woke up this morning thinking of different possibilities: Burning a candle.  Baking cookies.  Finding some girly hand lotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I walked into my living room and smelled exactly what I had to take a picture of: my bamboo plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong.  I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; my bamboo.  It&#39;s pretty and healthy and tall.  It survived my move down to Virginia.  However the water it was living in smelled like an aquarium gone bad.  Gross.  Needless to say, I cleaned up my bamboo.  And then took a picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://jhalabi.com/assets/images/posts/05-feb-something-i-smelled.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;February 5: Something I Smelled&quot; :width=&quot;75%&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, anyone who knows me also knows that I get a little obsessive with my camera.  Especially when I am near plants.  I cannot explain it -- it just happens.  And it happened today.  I really don&#39;t know how.  I hit the zoom.  Focused.  And got some pretty cool looking close-up shots of my awesome (and now non-smelly) plant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/02/february-photo-a-day-day-4/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day four.  It has been a busy month &lt;em&gt;(yes, already)&lt;/em&gt; and I have not had as much time as I would have liked lately to go to the gym.  For those of you who know me, I am a little addicted &lt;em&gt;(and fully admit it!)&lt;/em&gt;.  This  month will hopefully be one where I get back on track and start training for my &lt;em&gt;(second!)&lt;/em&gt; half marathon, coming up in June!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I give you day four&#39;s photo subject: hope.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Weekends are busy enough for me.  Add the Superbowl on top of that and... well... you get my photo-a-day a day late.  Day 3&#39;s subject was &amp;quot;something that starts with the letter &#39;e&#39;&amp;quot;.  This was harder than it sounds.  I was talking pictures of &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; objects all over the place and was not happy with any of them.  Then, finally, I walked into my home office and found what I was looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representing the letter &amp;quot;e&amp;quot; - a paper Etching I bought when I was in Switzerland last summer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And here is my photo for day 2!  Today&#39;s photo subject is &amp;quot;pattern&amp;quot;.  I have a lot of doilies around my house, most of which are from my mom.  This is one of them, currently sitting on my living room table.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2013/02/february-photo-a-day-day-1/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to try something different with my blog &lt;em&gt;(or... do something with my blog).&lt;/em&gt; I found a blog post about a &lt;a href=&quot;https://fatmumslim.com.au/category/photo-a-day-2/&quot;&gt;photo-a-day challenge for February&lt;/a&gt; and decided to give it a shot.  OK, I am a day late starting this, but here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1&#39;s photo subject is &amp;quot;fork&amp;quot;.  Just a fork is a little boring, so I decided to stage my fork a little.  Nothing fancy, but I like it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cheap trick with YUI carousel</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2011/08/cheap-trick-with-yui-carousel/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is just another example of why Internet Explorer 7 (and earlier) needs to die. I have been working on a project where a group of images needs to be displayed on a page, four at a time in a carousel. The site uses YUI 2.7, so naturally, I am using YUI Carousel to implement this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to displaying the images, the end user has the option to select one of these images to be selected as a primary image by clicking on that image. When the user selects a new primary image, a banner is displayed across the bottom of the image indicating its “primary” status. So, I added an event listener to add a div to the image’s container whenever said image is clicked. Simple enough, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope. Firefox was fine, but I came across an issue in IE where the carousel “jumped” so that my newly selected primary image displayed as the first image in the carousel and all other images ahead of it disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, clicking on an element in a YUI carousel causes that element to be selected. Selecting an element in a YUI Carousel in IE (apparently) forces that element to be displayed first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix? A hack!  Basically, the YUI Carousel comes with a “beforeSelectedItemChange” event, on which if you return false, the default behavior is negated.  This works for both Firefox and IE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;changePrimary = true;

imageCarousel.on(&amp;quot;beforeSelectedItemChange&amp;quot;, function() {
  if (changePrimary) {
    changePrimary = false;
    return false;
  }
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>Adding a character limit to a text area using YUI</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2011/07/character-limit-in-yui/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the UI world, it is a good idea to let the users know about any constraints they have on any form fields.  We all know this.  There are a million ways to do this –- through error messages, help text, and so on.  For character limits on input fields, the best way to avoid a user error is to limit the number of characters the user can physically type in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is super easy for input boxes.  Simply add the &lt;em&gt;maxlength&lt;/em&gt; attribute to the input HTML filed and &lt;em&gt;voila&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, text area fields are a bit trickier.  Character limits are not built into text area fields just yet as they are with input fields, so it is necessary to have a JavaScript implementation if you need to limit the text prior to submitting a form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So… I decided to write one.  I sort of ran away with this example, mostly because there are so many things to consider from a user perspective.  If someone is entering in a longer piece of text – for example, an e-mail to a customer service department or a review on a product – is it really better to just cut them off from entering more text before they have finished their thought?  True, the user will not be able to submit the form until their giant essay has been tamed to fit within the character constraints.  From a programmatic perspective, it is better to simply cut the user off.  This ensures a successful form submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are some people &lt;em&gt;(like me)&lt;/em&gt; who would much rather finish their thought, and then go back and edit the text down to size.  In this case, it is much more useful to have an &lt;em&gt;(obvious)&lt;/em&gt; indicator of how long the entered text is, so that the user knows how much needs to be cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short &lt;em&gt;(I know… too late)&lt;/em&gt;, I decided to create a proof of concept for limiting character limits that contains options for both scenarios above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Create a web page.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I created a very simple page with 3 elements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A text area input field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A message letting the user know how many characters they have typed and how many characters they are allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A check box to determine whether or not the text box will allow the user to continue to enter text once they have reached the character limit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Write the JavaScript.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript part of this POC contains 3 major functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Function to update the text area alert&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function is called as soon as the page loads and then each time a key is pressed &lt;em&gt;(on the keyup event)&lt;/em&gt; to update the number of characters used in the character limit message to the user.  Also, if the user has entered more characters than allowed by the limit, the truncate text area function is called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;function updateTextAreaAlert() {
  var text = Dom.get(&amp;quot;yui-textarea&amp;quot;).value;
  var charsUsed = text.length || 0;

  if (charsUsed &amp;gt;= textLimit) {
    Dom.addClass(&amp;quot;yui-textarea-chars&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;over-limit&amp;quot;);
    truncateTextArea();
  }
  else if (charsUsed &amp;gt;= textLimit * 0.9) {
    Dom.addClass(&amp;quot;yui-textarea-chars&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;near-limit&amp;quot;);
  }
  else {
    Dom.removeClass(&amp;quot;yui-textarea-chars&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;near-limit&amp;quot;);
    Dom.removeClass(&amp;quot;yui-textarea-chars&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;over-limit&amp;quot;);
  }

  Dom.get(&amp;quot;yui-textarea-chars&amp;quot;).innerHTML = charsUsed;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Function to check the text area limit.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function checks to see if the value of the text area field is longer than the set character limit.  If so, the function to truncate the text area’s contents is called.  This function is called each time a key is pressed on the key down event.  This is to avoid issues with the text “jumping” – the text area contents are actually updated after the key down event is called – so we call this function on key down so that we have a chance to suppress the content update if the user is over the character limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;function checkTextAreaLimit(e) {
  var text = Dom.get(&amp;quot;yui-textarea&amp;quot;).value;

  // Check to see if a delete key was pressed; backspace is 8; delete is 46.
   var key = (window.event) ? e.which: e.keyCode;
   var pressedDel = (key == 8 || key == 46) ? true : false;

  if (!allowOverLimit() &amp;amp;&amp;amp; text.length &amp;gt;= textLimit &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !pressedDel) {
    Event.preventDefault(e);
     truncateTextArea();
   }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Function to truncate the contents of the text area.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function truncates the text in the text area field if the user is over the character limit.  This function is called by the two functions listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;function truncateTextArea() {
  var text = Dom.get(&amp;quot;yui-textarea&amp;quot;).value;

  if (!allowOverLimit()) {
     Dom.get(&amp;quot;yui-textarea&amp;quot;).value = Dom.get(&amp;quot;yui-textarea&amp;quot;).value.substring(0, textLimit);
     Dom.get(&amp;quot;yui-textarea-chars&amp;quot;).innerHTML = Dom.get(&amp;quot;yui-textarea&amp;quot;).value.length;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

      <title>YUI 3 in a YUI 2 world</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2011/05/yui-3-in-a-yui-2-world/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know what you are probably thinking.  You want to use YUI 3 inside YUI 2?  Really?  Why not just upgrade to YUI 3 altogether?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question actually came up in one of my more recent projects, with a client who has been using YUI 2.7 for years now.  Would they like to make the leap to YUI 3?  Probably.  Do they have the time, resources, etc. to actually upgrade their (massive) site to YUI 3?  Not so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YUI 3, for those of you who have not yet checked it out, is a completely re-written library, and, so far, seems to be much slicker and more JQuery-esque than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YUI 3 still is not quite complete – at least, in terms of additional widgets.  The core library launched in September 2009, and the widgets available in YUI 2 have been in the process of being rewritten for and released into YUI 3.  This process is still ongoing as far as I can tell, but YUI 3 is clever enough to be able to incorporate YUI 2 libraries into its framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, some of the YUI 3 versions of these widgets are much improved over their YUI 2 counterparts.  So, for my client, the question came up: &lt;strong&gt;Can a YUI 3 widget get along with a core YUI 2 environment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short: I conducted a successful experiment using the YUI 3 Drag / Drop library inside a page that is otherwise using YUI 2.7.0 to create a pop-up dialog where users can reorder a group of content blocks by dragging 1 or more blocks to the desired location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check out the full version of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thatdevgirl/color-sequencing&quot;&gt;proof of concept on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.  There is also a short explanation of the basics below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Creating the dialog.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code to create a dialog is basic YUI 2 code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;openDialog: function() {
  if (COLORWAY.test.dialog == null) {
    COLORWAY.test.dialog = new YAHOO.widget.Dialog(&amp;quot;colorway-dialog-box&amp;quot;, {
      ... attributes go here ...
    });

    COLORWAY.test.dialog.setHeader(&amp;quot;Reorder Color Sequence&amp;quot;);
    COLORWAY.test.dialog.render(&amp;quot;document.body&amp;quot;);
  }

  COLORWAY.test.dialog.show();
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Selecting elements.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, this proof of concept was created to test dragging and dropping 1 element or multiple elements, therefore we need a way to determine whether or not the user is trying to select more than one element.  I opted for the user to hold the shift key down while selecting more than 1 element; however you can really use whatever key you want.  Just make sure to tell the user what to do!  &lt;em&gt;(I have instructions listed at the top of my dialog box.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My code is simple – and still using YUI 2.  If the user selects an element, add a “selected” class to that element.  If the user is pressing the shift key, do not remove the “selected” class from any other element that may be selected.  If the user is not pressing the shift key, unselect everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// If the shift key is not pressed, unselect all, then select that item.
if (!COLORWAY.test.shift) {
  var selected = Selector.query(&amp;quot;div.selected&amp;quot;, wrapper);
  for (var i=0; i&amp;lt;selected.length; i++) {
   Dom.removeClass(selected[i], &amp;quot;selected&amp;quot;);
  }
  Dom.addClass(target, &amp;quot;selected&amp;quot;);
}

// If the shift key is pressed and the item is selected, unselect it.
else if (Dom.hasClass(target, &amp;quot;selected&amp;quot;)) {
  Dom.removeClass(target, &amp;quot;selected&amp;quot;);
}

// If the shift key is pressed and the item is not selected, select it.
else {
    Dom.addClass(target, &amp;quot;selected&amp;quot;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Dragging element(s) to their new location.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here comes the fun part – dragging and dropping the selected elements.  This entire step is the YUI 3 part of the experiment.  A couple of things need to happen in this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to set up the node that is being dragged.  This happens in the &lt;strong&gt;Y.DD.DDM.on(‘drag:start’, function(e) {}&lt;/strong&gt; event function.  Here, we change the dragged node’ style, change the style of all of the other selected nodes (if they exist) using the e.target.get; so, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;e.target.get(&#39;dragNode&#39;).addClass(&#39;selected&#39;);

e.target.get(&#39;dragNode&#39;).setStyles({
    backgroundColor: e.target.get(&#39;node&#39;).getStyle(&#39;backgroundColor&#39;)
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to make sure we know which elements are being dropped into place, and determine if we are dropping 1 or multiple elements.  This is where the “selected” class comes in; all of this code is included in the &lt;strong&gt;Y.DD.DDM.on(‘drop:over’, function(e) {}&lt;/strong&gt; event function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;// Add node(s) to this list.
var selected = Selector.query(&amp;quot;#colorway-main-container div.selected&amp;quot;);

if (selected.length &amp;gt; 1) {
  for (var i=0; i&amp;lt;selected.length; i++) {
    e.drop.get(&#39;node&#39;).get(&#39;parentNode&#39;).insertBefore(selected[i], drop);
  }
} else {
  e.drop.get(&#39;node&#39;).get(&#39;parentNode&#39;).insertBefore(drag, drop);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the drag, all of the YUI 3 magic happens to animate the dragged node from its old location to a new location in the &lt;strong&gt;Y.DD.DDM.on(‘drag:drag’, function(e) {}&lt;/strong&gt; event function.  To be honest, I just copied the basic YUI 3 implementation into my code, but it worked exactly as I expected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot;&gt;Y.DD.DDM.on(&#39;drag:drag&#39;, function(e) {
  var y = e.target.lastXY[1];
  goingUp = (y &amp;lt; lastY) ? true : false;
  lastY = y;
  Y.DD.DDM.syncActiveShims(true);
});
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, once the node has been dragged to its final location, we reset the styles of the dragged node in the &lt;strong&gt;Y.DD.DDM.on(‘drag:end’, function(e) {}&lt;/strong&gt; event function, again using e.target.get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is a little more to the code than just this, but I’m not about to paste my entire source code into this post.  You can check out the completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thatdevgirl/color-sequencing&quot;&gt;proof of concept on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>YUI vs. jQuery</title>
      <link>https://jhalabi.com/blog/2010/09/yui-vs-jquery/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever since I started my consulting gig, I have been learning so many new &lt;em&gt;(or, rather, new to me)&lt;/em&gt; technologies.  Most of my learning experiences have centered around JavaScript libraries –- namely jQuery and YUI.  In light of the fact that I’ve only been consulting for about 9 months now, I’m going to preface this entire post with the fact that I definitely do not consider myself an expert in either of these libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it really boggles the mind (or, at least my mind) that YUI requires so much more complexity than jQuery does.  I mean, sure, YUI has neat features like data tables.  (I am sure jQuery does too, but I have not found it just yet.) However, it seems to be a struggle to even perform basic functions in YUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inexperience?  Maybe.  Frustrating?  Oh yes.  This has actually been bothering me since I started learning YUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, take a look at DOM selectors in both.  In jQuery, you can use the same syntax to select parts of the DOM by ID, class name, or tag.  You can even nest all of these things easily.  YUI definitely prefers all selection to be done by tag, though there are functions to get an array of elements by class name or tag, and nesting these things is not trivial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an exercise for a project at work, I created an example to illustrate my point regarding DOM selection between YUI and jQuery.  The example is simple – all it does is replace the text in a paragraph tag when a link is clicked.   The example DOM is minimal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;block&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;container-block&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;YUI Example&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;This is my original text.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;&amp;lt;a&amp;gt;#&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Click here to change the text above.&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I implemented the solution in both jQuery and YUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my jQuery implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;/js/jQuery.min.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  $(&amp;quot;#jQuery-block a&amp;quot;).click(function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
       $(&amp;quot;#jQuery-block p&amp;quot;).html(&amp;quot;This text was updated via jQuery.&amp;quot;);
  });
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is my YUI implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;/yui/yahoo-min.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;/yui/dom-min.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;/yui/event-min.js&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  var block = YAHOO.util.Dom.get(&amp;quot;yui-block&amp;quot;);
  var para = block.getElementsByTagName(&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;);
  var link = block.getElementsByTagName(&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;);

  if (link) {
    YAHOO.util.Event.addListener(link, &amp;quot;click&amp;quot;, function(e) {
    YAHOO.util.Event.preventDefault(e);
      if (para) { para[0].innerHTML = &amp;quot;This text was updated via YUI.&amp;quot;; }
    });
  }
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, I am grabbing the base libraries required for what I need to do here.  YUI requires 3 server calls for 3 different library files, but the 1 library file for jQuery is almost twice as large than the sum of the YUI files.  (The jQuery file is 24.1KB, whereas the sum of the 3 YUI files is 13.5KB.) So, I am going to call that a wash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my real issue with YUI is that I need to declare 3 variables and include an if statement to update this text, whereas with jQuery, I can accomplish the same task in 1 line.  (I’m not counting the prevent default commands for either case here, since the 2 are basically equivalent.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been my biggest pet peeve about YUI.  Again, I am not sure if it is due to inexperience, but the more I look at the YUI documentation, the more I think it is not me.&lt;/p&gt;
