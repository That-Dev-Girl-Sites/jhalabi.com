## Features

This plugin allows a content editor to turn on and off any WordPress post editor block. An editor can disable any block not currently in use on the site. Blocks that exist on at least one post or page are not eligible to be turned off.

This plugin also generates a list of all blocks in use by the site. A content editor can see how many times and on what posts or pages any particular block is used.
