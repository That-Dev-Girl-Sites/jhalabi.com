## Features

This plugin allows a content editor to turn on and off any post editor ("Gutenberg") block. An editor can only disable a block that is not currently in use. Blocks that exist on at least one post or page are not eligible to be turned off.

In addition, this plugin generates a list of all blocks in use by the site. A content editor can see how many times and on what posts or pages any particular block is used.
