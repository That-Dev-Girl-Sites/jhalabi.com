I am a senior web developer in Washington DC with over 20 years of programming experience. I have expertise in **custom theme creation** for content management systems, **Javascript application** architecture, and **eCommerce solution** development.

I initially started as purely a front-end developer, but I have been slowly migrating further back in the stack. As a result, I now call myself a **"middle-end" developer** and am working hard to make that term stick.

**Senior Javascript Front-End Developer** @ [Georgetown University](https://www.georgetown.edu/)

I work with a team of developers, designers, and product managers to create flexible and responsive themes for the University's school and department websites. These days, most of my work involves building custom WordPress editor (*Gutenberg*) blocks, such as promotional blocks, expandable content, and dynamic news blocks, using ReactJS and the Gutenberg API.
