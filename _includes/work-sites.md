### Whitehaven Playground

**Jekyll, jQuery, HTML 5, CSS, Bootstrap 4 (alpha)**

I created this site as part of our documentation efforts to encourage Drupal content editors be familiar with Bootstrap code supported in our website themes. Users were presented with a series of drop-down menu options, where they could select different components and their customization options. The site would then output the HTML code and its rendered results, and allow users to edit the code to see how their changed affected the output. This site launched in 2016, but is no longer available because Georgetown migrated away from Drupal in 2019.
