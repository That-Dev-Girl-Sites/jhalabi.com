This site is one of 350+ that our team develops and maintains.

### SemanticClarity

**Drupal 7, Sass, CSS, HTML**

I worked with SemanticClarity to create a new design based on their current branding and develop a flexible, responsive Drupal theme based on that design. The new site was on the Acquia platform. This site launched in February 2016, but the company no longer has a website, so this work is no longer available.

### [The Chicago Community Trust](https://www.cct.org/)

**Wordpress, Javascript, SASS, CSS, HTML**

I led the development of this project while working at Atlantic Media Strategies.
