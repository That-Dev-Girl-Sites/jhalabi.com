## Technical Skills

I have been exposed to many languages and technologies over the course of my career. I initially started as purely a front-end developer, but I have been slowly migrating further back in the stack. As a result, I now call myself a <strong>"middle-stack" developer</strong> and am working hard to make that term stick.

* **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Bourbon Neat, SVG, Twig, Handlebars
* **Javascript:** Vanilla Javascript, jQuery, jQuery UI, Node, React, JSX, Backbone, Marionette, D3
* **Languages:** PHP, Gulp, JSP, JSTL
* **Frameworks:** WordPress, WooCommerce, Jekyll, Drupal, Magento
