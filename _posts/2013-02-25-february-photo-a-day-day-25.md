Who knew this photo-a-day thing would get so personal?  OK- that is somewhat of a no-brainer, right?   Why do I ask?  Because today's photo subject was "on my bedside table".

So, internet readers: meet Baby.  I have had her literally forever.  She survived my childhood and she survived my 20-some-odd moves since then.
