The photo subject for the 27th: "playing".  Now, I don't really play that often.  At least, not the way I think of playing.  It has been forever since I jumped rope... or played hopscotch... or tag... or make believe with dolls.  (Ignore the fact that my house is littered with stuffed animals.)

However, one of my goals for this year is to re-learn how to play the piano.  I used to play... badly... a long time ago.  Teaching myself this time around has been easier than I thought it would be... and crazy fun.
