It has been a year. Some of us have had a really rough year, while others had a pretty good year, but feel awkward admitting that 2016 wasn't all that bad.

At the end of 2015, I had asked for a stranger new year. Not quite what I mean, but I think I got it. It was definitely a year filled with some pretty awful things, but a friend inspired me to focus on the positive, so here goes:

1. After getting laid off from a particularly toxic job at the end of 2015, I spent this year reinventing myself professionally. I started my own [one-woman consulting business](http://www.thatdevgirl.com/). I started teaching (and really liked it). One of my clients turned into a full-time job that I am really loving.
1. After burning out from running at the end of 2015 and having several terrible arguments with my joints, my knees and I have finally made peace and agreed upon a new running schedule that is making us all happy.
1. It was an exciting travel year, not so much in quantity, but definitely quality.  This year, I found myself in Alaska the week before my birthday with a fantastic group of friends.  I took a mini-trip in the fall to Minnesota and rounded out the year with a road trip through New England to ring in 2017.

This is the part where I make resolutions for next year, right?  

To be honest, I hate resolutions.  I resolve to run more or save more or read more or ride a unicorn across the country. And then do none of these things. And then feel bad when I look back and the end of the year and realize that I did none of these things.

So, no resolutions here! My plan is to be realistic and do things that are useful or joyful.  Shoot - is that a resolution in disguise?

Happy new year everyone!
