I logged onto my OB's website today to check out the latest updates to my medical records. I read through a bunch of new test. _(All of them are normal.)_ And then I discovered that I have been diagnosed with a new medical condition.

> "Supervision of elderly primigravida"

I know what most of those words are, but "primigravida"? WTF is that? According to [Webster's dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/primigravida):

> **primigravida:** an individual pregnant for the first time

Putting this all together, I have been diagnosed as an _elderly individual_ who is pregnant for the first time and needs supervision.

I am definitely pregnant and it is definitely my first time. I also definitely need supervision. But... _elderly_?!?! Again... WTF? I'm 40, not 400.

Don't mind my while I waddle myself to my next OB appointment with my walker. Kids these days.
