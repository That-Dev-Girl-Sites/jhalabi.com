Day four.  It has been a busy month _(yes, already)_ and I have not had as much time as I would have liked lately to go to the gym.  For those of you who know me, I am a little addicted _(and fully admit it!)_.  This  month will hopefully be one where I get back on track and start training for my _(second!)_ half marathon, coming up in June!

Therefore, I give you day four's photo subject: hope.
