Weekends are busy enough for me.  Add the Superbowl on top of that and... well... you get my photo-a-day a day late.  Day 3's subject was "something that starts with the letter 'e'".  This was harder than it sounds.  I was talking pictures of "e" objects all over the place and was not happy with any of them.  Then, finally, I walked into my home office and found what I was looking for.

Representing the letter "e" - a paper Etching I bought when I was in Switzerland last summer.
