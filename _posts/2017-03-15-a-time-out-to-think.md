My doctor-imposed 2-month delay on starting my treatment _(thank you chicken pox immunity woes)_ has given me a lot of time to think. Too much time, really.

The tech world has a phenomenon called “imposter syndrome”, where you are working in a position that you deserve to be in, but you don’t _think_ you are good enough to be in that position. You do your work and you do it well, but all the while, you have thoughts:

> “This isn’t good enough. I shouldn’t be working on this. Someone else can do this better. The team will figure this out eventually.”

I have been having impostor syndrome about my own theoretical role as **Mom**.

## My current inner dialog...

> “I can’t do this. I won’t be good enough to raise a child. Especially not by myself. Lots of people can do this better. Lots of people _already_ do this better. Someone will figure this out eventually.”
In my head, I go through all 18 years of this non-existent kid’s life in a matter of minutes and think about all the ways I will not be good enough.

## Time for a thought-shift.

I am in month 1 of this 2-month “wait for the chicken pox vaccine to work” hiatus. One month is more than enough time for my impostor syndrome thoughts to have life.

I am going to spend the next month churning up some real, positive thoughts.

* **I have a lot of love.** (Though sometimes showing emotion is hard.)
* **I have a lot of experience.** (That’s my way of saying being older is awesome.)
* **I have a lot of quirk.** (Life is too short to be “normal”.)
* **Therefore, I have a lot to give to my future child.** (Screw you, impostor syndrome. I’m awesome!)
