Today's photo subject was "full".  Today was also a crazy busy day at work _(from home)_, so I needed to find something "full" around my apartment.

It took a while, but I did find something: my sock drawer.  Sounds silly and ridiculous, but I am constantly going through socks.  I lose socks. I wear through socks.  I layer socks.  Seriously. If it is cold out, I will wear 3 pairs of socks at once.  So, I have a lot of socks.
