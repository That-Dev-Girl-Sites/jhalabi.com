It's Induction Day!

I check into the hospital at 4pm today to get induced. As far as I can tell, we are still starting from 0. My belly has not dropped. I am not having contractions. My water has not broken. I am guessing I am not dilated. The kiddo is still kicking high. I suppose she really likes it in there.

Sorry kid. Time to go.
