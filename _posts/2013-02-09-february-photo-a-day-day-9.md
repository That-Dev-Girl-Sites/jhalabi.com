Day nine's photo subject was "guilty pleasure".  The dictionary defines a guilty pleasure as something you do that brings you joy, but you feel guilt about doing.  This is probably going to sound like a cliche... or a lie... but I do not really do things that make me happy _and_ that I am embarrassed about.  However, I did think of one thing that I do - or rather eat - that makes me happy but I probably should not have quite so often.

Chocolate.

Chocolate is awesome.  It makes me happy.  And I am not ashamed of it.  Well... except perhaps the fact that right now I am eating Hershey's chocolate.  Still awesome... but there is definitely better chocolate out there.  _(I miss Switzerland.)_
