Joni is a full time developer. Joni is a single mom with a 4 year old. Joni is a newly _(almost)_ published author. _(T-3 days until launch!)_ Joni is a self-published author, which means Joni is also a PR agent. How does she do it all? We don't know. She’s not sure either. Seriously, it’s amazing everyone is still in one piece and the house didn’t burn down.

## Getting a little serious now.

Really, when did I get so busy? Back in my younger years, I would go to work, come home, and call it a day. These days? Not so much. I still go to work, but I no longer commute. _(Thanks pandemic?)_[^1] Theoretically, I should have more free time now, but I have a 4 year old, so in reality, I have less free time. In fact, I am in free-time debt.

## When in Rome...

Obviously, the natural solution to having no free time is to write and publish a book. Because, when you have _(time)_ debt, why not get some more?[^2]

[_Sweet Little You_](/book) is 100% a passion project. In fact, before writing the book, I was actually considering going to grad school to study machine learning.[^3] However, the idea for this book came to me with such a force, I couldn't stop myself from writing it. After that, I had this baby of a book that I just _needed_ to edit and proofread and get reviewed. I found myself looking up illustrators and typing "how to self-publish a children's book" into my browser. 

## Long story short.

Nearly one year later, here we are. [_Sweet Little You_](/book) will be officially born[^4] on August 1, just 3 short days from when I am writing this.

So now, when I am not working my regular job and when I'm not being a mom, _(though, let's get real, when I am I ever not being a mom??)_, I am the exclusive PR representative for... me. It's not a terrible arrangement so far. PR-rep-me has already lined up book reviews, interviews, and even a little bit of buzz on Instagram. If release day goes well, I may even double her salary. 

In the meantime, actual-me doesn't have time to sleep much, which is how I find myself writing rambling articles about my lack of work/life balance at 12:58am. It's OK. Sleep is for the weak.

I'm kidding. Sleep is good for you. Go get your 8 hours of sleep and, while you're at it, eat well, exercise, and watch plenty of sci fi. Your balanced-you will thank you.



[^1]: Not to be glib, because the pandemic, especially the early parts, were _awful_. I could get into that more, but I won't. At least not here. Maybe in another blog post. But the pandemic is directly related to my now-permanent work-from-home status, and that is a change that I never, ever want to revert.
[^2]: This is terrible advice, financial or otherwise. Do not, under any circumstances, listen to me.
[^3]: True story.
[^4]: Books are "born" on their official release date. Seems fitting here, since this is a book for babies.
