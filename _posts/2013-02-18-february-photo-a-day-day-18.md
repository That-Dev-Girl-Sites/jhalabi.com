I had a fantastic weekend.  So fantastic, that I just found the time to work on yesterday's photo of the day.  Typical I know.

What made this even funnier was yesterday's photo subject: something I don't like.  After an awesome weekend filled with (mostly) positive things, I have to think about something I don't like?

Oddly, that came to me easier today.  After a long weekend filled with music, friends, and several late nights, my body decided to rebel.  Yes... I got sick.  So, my dear reader, I present to you something I definitely do not like right now - not because it is not helping me immensely, but because I actually need it right now.
