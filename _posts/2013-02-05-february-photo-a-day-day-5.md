OK, this story is a little gross.  Day 5's photo subject was "something you smelled".  I woke up this morning thinking of different possibilities: Burning a candle.  Baking cookies.  Finding some girly hand lotion.

And then I walked into my living room and smelled exactly what I had to take a picture of: my bamboo plant.

Don't get me wrong.  I _love_ my bamboo.  It's pretty and healthy and tall.  It survived my move down to Virginia.  However the water it was living in smelled like an aquarium gone bad.  Gross.  Needless to say, I cleaned up my bamboo.  And then took a picture:

Now, anyone who knows me also knows that I get a little obsessive with my camera.  Especially when I am near plants.  I cannot explain it - it just happens.  And it happened today.  I really don't know how.  I hit the zoom.  Focused.  And got some pretty cool looking close-up shots of my awesome (and now non-smelly) plant.
