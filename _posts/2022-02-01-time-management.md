Once upon a time, there was a (not exactly) young girl who decided to have a full-time tech job, solo-parent a pre-schooler, and publish a book. "I am so organized!" she exclaimed. "I can totally manage my time to get this done."

## Act I, scene 1: Hahahaha

_[Cue the universe, laughing, saying "Oh really? Hold my beer."]_

Enter school closures. And snow (in the mid-Atlantic, where they think they can handle snow, but they really can't). And red alert worthy emergencies at work... _all month_. And weekend weather so icky, that you need to organize indoor, Covid-friendly activities for the aforementioned pre-schooler.

_[Spotlight on a really exhausted human.]_

## Next scene: Remembering the excitement

This really exhausted human is also at the beginning stages of having her book illustrated. I found a really amazing illustrator and, upon seeing the first drafts of the start of the book, I. Am. __Excited__!

There is still a ton of work to do, but seeing the main characters - mommy and baby - in real, illustrated life has made this book feel real. It was a real book before, but practically speaking, it was really just a cute poem.

I am dying to share more about the illustrations, but I am practicing my patience. I promise a cover reveal will happen when the time is right. Just not quite yet.

## Act II: I have so much to do! Ahhhh!

This excitement has made me realize that I have _so_ much work to do. Mostly marketing. Constant marketing.

I have no idea how to market anything.

For the last 20 years, I have been working with code. Not working alone, but certainly not getting other people to buy the things I code. That's what the marketing department was for.<sup>1</sup> Now... _I'm_ the marketing department.

Well... that's terrifying. What do I do? Shout into the void?<sup>2</sup> I mean, I'm tweeting more and have 400+ followers now! Yes, I know that's not a giant amount - and a good amount of my followers are fellow techies - but it's certainly more than before. That's a start. Right?

In reality, I do have a (very large) to do list of marketing ideas that I need to get started on. As soon as I have more time.

1. At least, when I worked for agencies. Not exactly applicable to the higher ed world that I am a part of now.
2. If you are in the void with me and reading this, <a href="mailto:joni@jhalabi.com">shout back!</a> I'd love to hear from you.
