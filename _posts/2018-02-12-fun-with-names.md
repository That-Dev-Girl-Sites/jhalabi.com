Since my pregnancy announcement, and especially since my "it's a girl!" announcement, I have gotten _a lot_ of name suggestions. This is despite the fact that I have already decided on the kiddo's name.

Regardless, I decided it would be fun to compile all of these suggestions here for posterity _(and future amusement)_. In no particular order, they are:

* Christine
* Sherifa
* Nadine
* Josephine
* Paula
* Paula Josephine
* Josephine Paula
* Sherifa Josephine Paula
* Kimm
* Tim
* _not_ Madison
* _not_ Candi _(or any stripper name)_
* 9 stripper names strung together
* Alberta
* Alberta Jonisdottir
* Albert, Ice Queen of the Rockies
* Idina
* Elizabeth
* Mia
* Jeffrey
* Aspartame _(pronounced Ass-par-tah-may)_
* Gertrude
* Trixie
* Mildred
* Imogene
* Bertha
* Melba
* Buttercup
* Gryselda
* Lord Kickass
* Guacamole
* Guacamily
* Samia
* Tiya
* Felicity Ursula _(a.k.a. FU)_
* Mayhem
* Lightning _(because home insurance usually covers incidental damage done by Lightning)_
* Chaos
* Dragon
* Crumbelina
* Adorabeezle
* Mayzie
* Mayzie McMonkey McBean
* Mahn
* Helen
* Wallaby
* Rudolph
* Surprise!

Again, I have already decided what my daughter's name will be. But keep the suggestions coming. This is fun.

_(Additional updates have been made throughout March, May, and July, 2018.)_
