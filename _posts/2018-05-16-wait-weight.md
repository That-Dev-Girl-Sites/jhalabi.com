excerpt: One of my biggest worries about getting pregnant was the inherent weight gain that comes with it.

One of my biggest worries about getting pregnant was the inherent weight gain that comes with it. Yes, I know that sounds really superficial. Yes, I know that I am growing a _second human_ inside of my body and, of course, she adds to my overall weight.

## When I was young(er)

I have had a lot of issues with my body image throughout my entire life. When I was younger, I couldn't run to the corner without feeling like I was about to die. As a teenager, I would read teen magazines that would say things like "if you can pinch an inch, you need to lose 10 pounds"... and then I would discover that I could pinch _way_ more than an inch. I would look at my thighs and see them literally double in width when I sat down.

I know what you're thinking - I should love my body no matter what size or shape it is. And you're right. But, let's also face facts here. I was far from the pinnacle of health in my youth.

It is why I stopped eating beef when I was 18. It is why I decided to finally check out the gym when I was 22. It is why started running when I was 24. _(Well, there was also this boy... never mind.)_ It is why I tried out yoga - and practiced for years. It is why I started boxing. It (and the fact that I am super competitive) is why I ran a marathon at 37. _(Random aside: The genetics that gave me my family's knees are why I will never run another marathon.)_

Eventually, I became _much_ healthier and my body reflected that. I lost a bunch of weight. I gained a bunch of muscle. Yet I was still not 100% happy with how I looked. I am perpetually curvy. And it didn't help that every so often, before I got pregnant, someone would ask me if I was pregnant.

## Important message to the universe

**Do not** ask a woman if she is pregnant **unless you see an actual baby coming out of her.**

## Flash forward

I am now in my third trimester. I've gained weight _(obviously)_ and I am now officially back _up_ to my high school weight. I knew this would happen _(again, obviously)_ and I look _nothing_ like I did in high school and college. However, it is still a weird and emotional milestone. _(Thanks, hormones?)_

At least this time around, I have a good reason to be here.
