One of my biggest worries about getting pregnant was the inherent weight gain that comes with it. Yes, I know that sounds really superficial. Yes, I know that I am growing a _second human_ inside of my body and, of course, she adds to my overall weight.

## When I was young(er)

I have had a lot of issues with my body image throughout my entire life. When I was younger, I couldn't run to the corner without feeling like I was about to die. As a teenager, I would read teen magazines that would say things like "if you can pinch an inch, you need to lose 10 pounds"... and then I would discover that I could pinch _way_ more than an inch. I would look at my thighs and see them literally double in width when I sat down.

I know what you're thinking - I should love my body no matter what size or shape it is. And you're right. But, let's also face facts here. I was far from the pinnacle of health in my youth.

It is why I stopped eating beef when I was 18. It is why I decided to finally check out the gym when I was 22. It is why started running when I was 24. _(Well, there was also this boy... never mind.)_ It is why I tried out yoga - and practiced for years. It is why I started boxing. It (and the fact that I am super competitive) is why I ran a marathon at 37. _(Random aside: The genetics that gave me my family's knees are why I will never run another marathon.)_

Eventually, I became _much_ healthier and my body reflected that. I lost a bunch of weight. I gained a bunch of muscle. Yet I was still not 100% happy with how I looked. I am perpetually curvy. And it didn't help that every so often, before I got pregnant, someone would ask me if I was pregnant.

## Important message to the universe

**Do not** ask a woman if she is pregnant **unless you see an actual baby coming out of her.**

## Flash forward

I am now in my third trimester. I've gained weight _(obviously)_ and I am now officially back _up_ to my high school weight. I knew this would happen _(again, obviously)_ and I look _nothing_ like I did in high school and college. However, it is still a weird and emotional milestone. _(Thanks, hormones?)_

At least this time around, I have a good reason to be here.
