Something happened this weekend. Something big. I got the final illustrations for _Sweet Little You_! **OMG OMG OMG!!**

I have been working with [Lisa Wee](https://www.lisawee12.com/), a wonderfully talented illustrator, for the last few months and I couldn't be happier with the final version.

I am self-publishing and still working on an official release date, but expect this book to be available **summer 2022**. For now, I am very excited to reveal the cover of _Sweet Little You_:
