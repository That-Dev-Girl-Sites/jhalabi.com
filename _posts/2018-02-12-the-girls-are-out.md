I have to say that, so far, my second trimester has been quite pleasant. I finally feel less tired. _(Read: I am no longer sleeping 12 hours a day.)_ I am definitely not nauseous. I may almost go as far as saying that I feel like my pre-pregnancy self. Almost.

I am still feeling and seeing changes in my body. My skinny pants no longer fit. My big pants are no longer falling down.

Other than the obvious belly changes, it is a well known fact that a woman's breasts grow too. However, this barely-34-B-cup woman was not expecting exactly how this change would pan out.

I grew out of my regular bras pretty a while ago and switched to my stretched out "I have some room in these" bras pretty quickly. In just a matter of weeks, I started popping out of _those_ bras. And they hurt. And I wanted to rip out their underwires and stab the rest of the bras with them.

So yeah. I clearly needed new bras.

I went to mall this past weekend to shop. (Those of you who truly know me that just going to the mall period is an act of desperation.) I walked into the (very crowded) store and found someone to size me up.

34D.

WTH.

D?!

Ok, most of you are laughing at me right now. Fair enough. But considering I never thought I would get to a proper C cup, this is insanity to me. And the crazy part is, _I'm still growing._

TL;DR: For the first time in my life, I have cleavage. This is awesome.
