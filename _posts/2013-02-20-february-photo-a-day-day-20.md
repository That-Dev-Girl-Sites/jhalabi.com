I have been falling a little behind in my photo taking again, so here I am, working on two photo posts at once.  Yesterday's photo subject was "where I stood".  Since it is tax season and the end of winter, I have been doing a little bit of organizing and cleaning around the apartment _(more-so than usual, that is)_.

My new apartment does not have a whole lot of storage space, but it does have really high ceilings, so I have been building up - shelves built up on top of other shelves, etc.  It is a little crazy looking, but it gets the job done.
