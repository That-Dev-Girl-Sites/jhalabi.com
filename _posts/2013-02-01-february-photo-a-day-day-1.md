I decided to try something different with my blog _(or... do something with my blog)._ I found a blog post about a [photo-a-day challenge for February](http://fatmumslim.com.au/category/photo-a-day-2/) and decided to give it a shot.  OK, I am a day late starting this, but here it goes.

Day 1's photo subject is "fork".  Just a fork is a little boring, so I decided to stage my fork a little.  Nothing fancy, but I like it.
