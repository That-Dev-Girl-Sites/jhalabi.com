Today's photo subject is "entrance".  Now, I really did not want to take a picture of a door, because that felt really boring and obvious.  However, how else do you really enter a space?  It is through a door or an archway or some other separator.

OK. Entrance equals door, basically.  This all got me thinking, what if you don't really know what is beyond the entrance?  Or, what if you just want to check out what is beyond the entrance without really committing to going through?

Given that I work from home and really do not have the time to go out and explore unfamiliar entrances in my neighborhood _(and believe me -- there are plenty here)_, I decided to try to recreate this scenario of unfamiliar entrances in my very familiar home.  This is what I came up with:
