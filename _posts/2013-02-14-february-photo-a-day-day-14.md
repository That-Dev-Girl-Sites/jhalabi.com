Well, assuming I have a following here, you have been following my photo-a-day journey for just about 2 whole weeks.  That is amazing - that both I am still taking pictures and you are still looking at them.  So... thank you!

I am sorry to say that I am skipping #14.  It is not out of laziness or boredom, and I still completely plan to finish out this month of picture taking.  However, I just cannot do today.

Today is February 14.  Valentine's Day.  Today's photo subject is "love is...".   I am single, and my feelings about the matter are... well... complicated.  Too complicated.  I don't really want to think about it.  What love means to me and where my heart is at right now is breaking me, and I have neither the creativity nor the desire right now to try to take a picture of that.

Perhaps next year, but in the meantime, there will be more photos... tomorrow.
