2015 was a strange, strange year.

I started the year with a brand new job that had a ton of potential.  I later discovered working for that particular company was a huge mistake and, after being miserable for several months, had the opportunity to walk away in October.  After about 5 minutes of soul-searching _(long winded introspection is not really my thing)_, I decided that jumping to another company would be another mistake.

## So I decided to go rogue.

I mean, why work as a consultant through an agency when I can simply work as a consultant as myself?  Right?

Yes, that is completely crazy.  I mean - agencies exist for a reason and I have *zero* experience in the business world.  I have never had to market myself to anyone.  Not to mention deal with invoicing and contracts and taxes, etc.

It took me about 2 minutes of soul-searching before I hit send on my first batch of "cold-call" marketing messages.

## Fast forward 2 months.

I am very close to launching my first client site as a "rogue" developer.  I have 2 more sites in progress.  I am teaching my very own class at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/).  And, I just signed 2 long-term contracts with a couple of really big organizations.  _(Not dropping names yet, but you've definitely heard of them.  And one rhymes with "Shmacys".)_

Not bad for someone with no practical business experience.

Yes, my work life is more complicated.  My schedule is more complicated.  Taxes are more complicated.  _(Thank goodness for CPAs.)_  But having control over my own time and flexibility?  Priceless.
