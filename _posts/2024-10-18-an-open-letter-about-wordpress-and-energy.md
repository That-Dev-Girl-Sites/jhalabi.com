Dear Matt,

I am tired. This is not the kind of tired that a good night's sleep will solve. This kind of tired stems from having too much on my plate -- both good and terrible. I started a new role at work that I am beyond excited about. _(Good.)_ I am a single parent to an amazing 6 year-old. _(Really good.)_ As for the terrible, they are personal things that I will only share privately. 

This combination of good and terrible things take up my space, time, and energy. Actually, let me correct that. They take up **all** my space, time, and energy.

You are relevant to my professional space. My current professional life is linked to WordPress. I love WordPress. I love Gutenberg.[^1] I write [plugins](/coding/) that live in Plugin Directory. Most of my [presentations](/speaking/) center around WordPress, be it developing blocks, writing accessible markup, or discussing the latest updates to Gutenberg. I have friends within the WordPress community -- friends I otherwise would never have met. I even _(somewhat accidentally)_ started the push within my current organization to migrate our 400+ sites from a different CMS into WordPress.

I have no regrets about my ties to WordPress. It is a solid system that I love creating with and developing for. You could even make the argument that I _need_ WordPress.

What I _do not need_ is for the leader of WordPress to go off the rails in some _(seemingly personal)_ battle that has only succeeded in creating uncertainty and distrust in the larger WordPress community.

I appreciate the need to protect the WordPress name. I really do! I have had my own share of copyright issues. I have needed to send cease-and-desist letters to people selling my _(otherwise free)_ written works. That is never fun.

However, there is a difference between defending your intellectual property and setting half the internet on fire.[^2] Prior to last month, I was never concerned about the future of WordPress. I never had a reason to be. Now, I do. This goes back to my space, time, and energy problem.

I should not have to make space in my life to worry about the damage being done to WordPress and our community. I should not have to spend time losing trust in a system that I have worked in for years. I should not have to spend energy watching a grown adult have more meltdowns than my literal child.[^3] I _do not_ have the space, time, or energy for _any_ of this. 

I am tired. And angry. And extremely disappointed. This is not the behavior of a leader.

I expected better from you, and it is definitely time for a time out. Go sit in a corner and think about what you've done.

Sincerely, <br>
An exhausted code mom



[^1]: Is liking Gutenberg still controversial? Whatever. I meant what I said.
[^2]: I will not rehash the entire battle _(to date)_. Some great resources on the subject already exist. I really like [one resource in particular](https://wpvswpe.report/), but I am sure there are others.
[^3]: My kid is great and, at 6, has far fewer meltdowns than she did at 3. However, she _is_ a kid and the occasional meltdown is expected. I expect more emotional maturity from adults.
