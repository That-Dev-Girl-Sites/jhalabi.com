I am 37 weeks today and the wait is killing me. I know she's coming out soon and I think my belly is starting to drop, but the kiddo has not made her move yet. It seems she's not even close. I mean, even my Braxton-Hicks contractions have toned themselves down.

The kiddo is kicking more, true to her code name (Lord Kick Ass). The kicking is mostly in my ribs (right side only), but I think that is because she is already head down and, frankly, her legs have nowhere else to go.

I am actually pretty torn about the waiting game of these last few weeks. On the one hand, she is so much more portable while she is on the "inside". On the other hand, I really can't wait to meet this tiny human that has been inside my belly for so long, to see what she's really like in "real life". (Also, I miss sleeping on my stomach.)

## Q & A time

I have been getting a lot of questions from friends (and the occasional stranger) now that I am towards the end, so here are some FAQs for you all.

**What cravings are you having?**

None. Seriously. I think I'm defective.

Don't get me wrong. I'm totally eating up a storm. I'm just not craving anything in particular.

Except ice. Is that a craving? My ice maker has been working overtime the last couple of months.

**Are you about to give birth right here in my living room?**

No. I'm pretty sure it doesn't work that way.

**You're so active. WTF?**

I have no idea. It probably has something to do with the fact that I was running up through week 30-ish. I'm even still working out, for some definition of "working out". Frankly, I'm just thankful that I'm not a giant blob on the couch. _(I know that sounds like heaven to some of you all, but that would be torture for me.)_

**How are you dealing with the massive heat we're having?**

Air conditioning. As an introvert, I don't want to leave the house anyway. So... win-win?

## Ready for go time... kinda

My bags are packed and in the car. Technically _(as in, on paper)_ I am ready for the kiddo to come. Mentally... that is another story. To be honest, childbirth hasn't really hit me yet _(though, I'm sure it will soon!)_.
