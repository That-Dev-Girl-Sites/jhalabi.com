I am a little bit behind in my blogging here, but I had my 4th IUI last Tuesday, which means as of today, I am 6 dpiui.

## Medication update

I am on progesterone, which if you were paying attention to my previous post about medications, is that pill you take vaginally. _(Again... ugh.)_

I am happy to report that the pill-taking process is going well, in that I am successfully taking the meds. Funny thing about progesterone - it makes you bleed. This is a common and very expected side effect. This is also not a side effect I am thrilled with. My nurse told me that a panty liner will be sufficient for the bleeding. It is not. While I am not bleeding a ton _(it is certainly not enough to fill an entire maxi pad)_, I am definitely - and regularly - bleeding enough where a liner is not going to cover it.

The good thing about the bleeding is that it starts almost immediately and it is over in under an hour.

## Symptom update

I believe that the reason why I forgot about posting here for a while is because I have been feeling no symptoms. Well... minimal symptoms.

My symptoms are so minimal that I am not sure if they are symptoms at all:

1. Two nights ago, I was eating a turkey dinner in a mason jar - complete with potatoes, gravy, and cranberry sauce. I love all of these things; however this combination was surprisingly disgusting. I can chalk that up to the recipe.
1. I have a weird ache in my lower abdomen. No idea what that's about.
1. I feel almost (but not quite) nauseous every so often. No actual nausea. Most of the time it's gas.

Are these real symptoms or am I subconsciously working myself up? We'll find out soon, I suppose!
