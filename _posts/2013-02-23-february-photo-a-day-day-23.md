A little behind again, but hey - it was a weekend.  Saturday's photo subject was "word".   So, I spent all day with my camera, taking pictures of words wherever I went.  Which was weird.  I did take other pictures too!  But going from taking a photo of a gorgeous landscape - I was in the middle of VA wine country on Saturday - to taking a picture of a single word on a sign is... well... a little strange.

Anyway, the word that I found actually came later that night, when I went to a concert at [The Music Loft](http://www.themusicloftonline.com/) in Herndon to see [Wreckless Eric and Amy Rigby](https://wrecklessericamyrigby.bandcamp.com/).  _(Good show!)_ The word - "working" - just seemed appropriate given the month I have had at work. _(The sign was actually announcing the duo's latest album.)_
