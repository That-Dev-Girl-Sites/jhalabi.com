And last but not least... the 28th!  Today's photo subject was "upside down", which gave me a great excuse to hang around... well... upside down.  Seeing my office upside down was the most fun.  My apartment does not have a whole lot of storage space, but it has high ceilings.  So to help with office storage, I built up.
