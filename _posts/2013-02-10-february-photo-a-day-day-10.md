I am having the world's laziest Sunday.  I woke up after 10:00 this morning.  I have spent most of the day on my couch.  I did work on my website a little and take some pictures, but I have never really considered that to be work.  I spent a good chunk of the afternoon reading.  And I am still in my pjs.  It has been glorious.
