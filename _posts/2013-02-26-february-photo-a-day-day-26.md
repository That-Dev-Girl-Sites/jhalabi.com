The photo subject for the today was "quiet".  Taking a picture of actual quiet stumped me at first.  What is quiet?  Especially in my life.  I like background noise.  A lot.  TV, music, podcasts, whatever.  I am a city girl, so.. well.. my neighborhood is not all that quiet.  And I am terrible at meditating.

I was at the gym when I found the inspiration for today's photo: my headphones.  They are both loud and quiet - loud in my ears _(don't worry... not too loud)_, but quiet for everyone else.
