The day 6 photo subject was "soft".   Now, I am a stuffed animal addict and have them _all over_ my apartment.  Seriously.  On my bed.  On my night stand.  In a basket in the corner.  On my living room end table.  For a while, on my dining room table.  _(I later decided that was a little excessive.)_  So, my subject matter for today's photo was immediately obvious for me.
