As I begin to tell more and more people about my pregnancy as a single mother-to-be, I have gotten a lot of questions. So many, that I decided to keep a list.

1. You're not waiting until you find a husband?
1. Why don't you want to get married?
1. Are you gay?
1. Wait, you _really_ don't want to get married?
1. How are you feeling?
1. Your doctor wants you to eat_how_ often? Isn't she worried about you gaining weight?
1. Are you having twins?
1. Are you _sure_ it's not twins?
1. Seriously, you're not having twins, right?
1. You know this is hard, right?
1. Like, really, really hard?
1. Did you even think about this?

I was expecting both positive and negative reactions (and questions). To be honest, I wasn't expecting mean, but, well, mean people don't really belong in my life anyway.

Mind you, I'm not answering any of these questions here. This is a list of questions, not answers. _(However, I will say that ice cream is on the list of recommended foods for nausea from my doctor.)_ If you want answers, feel free to find me in the wild and ask in person. Or, in the case of some of these questions, don't.
