**She kicked me!**

I was laying in bed last night _(or rather, this morning, since it was after midnight)_ and felt a soft, but distinct, kick coming from inside my belly.

My kid kicked me.

This means 3 things:

1. She has legs.
1. She has leg muscles.
1. Her legs are long enough to reach the inside lining of my belly.

Therefore, she will be a soccer player. Or a kickboxer. Or a Rockette.
