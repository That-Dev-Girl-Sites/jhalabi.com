Today's lucky photo subject was "walking".  Sadly, I completely forgot about it until I got home tonight... after dark... in the rain.  I went for a walk around my complex.  Looking around my neighborhood, I realized it is not a particularly inspiring or visually interesting area.  So, instead, I decided to look down.
