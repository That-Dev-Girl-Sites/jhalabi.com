Hi there! My name is **Joni** and I am a _"middle-end"_ web developer who loves to write code, commit often, and make up her own titles.

## Details, please!

I work for the Web Services department at Georgetown University as a "Senior Javascript Front-End Developer" and live just outside of Washington DC. I have been writing code since the mid-1980s. I was 2. _(Kidding. Mostly. Yes, I know I'm dating myself. Shush.)_

I primarily write in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript**, but I work a lot in WordPress these days, so I spend a lot of time with **PHP** too.

## Cool! What else?

I am a single by choice mother to an **amazing pre-schooler** who constantly keeps me on my toes. She and her collection of dinosaurs are going to take over the world.

**I have hobbies.** Stop laughing. I really do! I both run and bake, because life is all about balance. I love live music and try to get as many shows as time and babysitters allow. I pretend to knit, by which I mean that I have been working on the same shawl for about 5 years now. I am also learning to play the ukulele, but only when my daughter can't hear me. My skills are not quite up to her standards _(yet?)_. Just wait until I take up the bongos.

**I love to travel.** I have been lucky enough to visit parts of Europe and the Middle East. I have road tripped across a good chunk of the western US and day-hiked in Alaska. I have camped at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival and the RPI hockey line. _(Camping for college hockey tickets is almost like real camping, right?)_

**I love books!** I love to read and have books in just about every room of my house. Unfortunately, my reading has dwindled post-baby, but I do [keep track of what I read](/about/books/), in case you all are interested.
