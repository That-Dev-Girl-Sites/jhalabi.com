Hi there! My name is **Joni** and I make websites.

## Details, please!

I am a **web developer** and **teacher**. I work for Georgetown University and live just outside of Washington DC. I have been writing code since the mid-1980s. I was 2. _(Kidding, though I know I'm dating myself anyway.)_

I primarily write in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript**, but I work a lot in WordPress these days, so I spend a lot of time with **PHP** too.

## Cool! What else?

I am a single mother by choice mother to an **amazing toddler** who definitely keeps me on my toes. She and her collection of dinosaurs are going to take over the world.

**I have hobbies.** Stop laughing; I really do! I both run and bake, because life is all about balance. I love live music and try to get as many shows as time and babysitters allow. I pretend to knit, by which I mean that I have been working on the same shawl for about 5 years now. I am also learning to play the ukulele, but only when my daughter can't hear me, because my skills are not _(yet?)_ up to her standards. Just wait until I take up the bongos.

**I love to travel.** I have been lucky enough to visit parts of Europe and the Middle East. I have road tripped across a good chunk of the western US and day-hiked in Alaska. I have camped at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival and the RPI hockey line. _(Camping for college hockey tickets is almost like real camping, right?)_
