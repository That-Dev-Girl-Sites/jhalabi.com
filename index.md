## Sweet Little You

<div class="book-cover-placeholder book-cover-placeholder-float">
  Illustrations coming soon!
</div>

*Sweet Little You* is a welcome baby story, specifically for little ones born to single-by-choice parents. It is a rhyming welcome from their parent, introducing their family structure and (very basically) how they came to be. __Coming summer 2022!__

I am surprised as you are that I wrote a book, but it's true! Check out my "coming out" [#amWriting post](/blog/am-writing) and follow me to for news about my self-publishing journey.

## About Joni

![My daughter and me](/assets/images/family.jpg)

My name is **Joni** and I am a **"middle-end" web developer** who loves to write code, commit often, and make up her own job titles. I work for Georgetown University and have been writing code since the mid-1980s. I was 2. _(Kidding. Mostly. I know I'm dating myself. Shush.)_

I have developed in all sorts of languages, but I work a lot in WordPress these says, so I spend a lot of time with **JavaScript** and **PHP**. Click around this site for more information about [my work](/work) and [me speaking about my work](/speaking).

### Cool! What else?

I am a single by choice mother to an **amazing pre-schooler** who constantly keeps me on my toes. She and her collection of stuffed animals are going to take over the world.

**I have hobbies.** Stop laughing. I'm serious. I both run and bake, because life is all about balance. I love live music and try to get as many shows as time and babysitters allow. I pretend to knit, by which I mean that I have been working on the same shawl for about 5 years now. I am also learning to play the ukulele, but only when my daughter can't hear me. My skills are not quite up to her standards _(yet?)_. Just wait until I take up the bongos.

**I love to travel.** I have been lucky enough to visit parts of Europe and the Middle East. I have road tripped across a good chunk of the western US and day-hiked in Alaska. I have camped at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival and the RPI hockey line. _(Camping for college hockey tickets is like real camping, right?)_

**I love books!** I love to read and have books in just about every room of my house. Unfortunately, my reading has dwindled post-baby, but I do [keep track of what I read](/books/reading/), in case you all are interested.
