## Hello World!

I am “middle-end” web developer who likes to write code, commit often, and make up my own titles. I have spent the last 20 years developing solutions for a wide variety of industries and organizations. I currently specialize in developing CMS themes and WordPress editor customizations. I [enjoy speaking at technical conferences](/speaking), and have also taught continuing education coding classes. 

When I am not writing code, I write [technical articles](/blog) and [creative works](/book) focusing on life as a single mother by choice. I enjoy running, practicing yoga, reading, and seeing live music near my home in the Washington, D.C. area.

## About Joni

I wrote my first line of code in BASIC on an Apple iiC, sitting in my parent's basement. Soon after that moment, I wrote my first `GOTO` statement, sending that computer into a fiery fit, smoke blasting from its ears.

Or something like that.

In reality, I spent my childhood around computers, be it that Apple iiC, my beloved TI 99/4A, or eventually an IBM ThinkPad. I also spent my childhood among books. My dream was to move into our town library. Piles of journals (and old computers) crowd my home office today.
