My name is Joni and I am a **web developer**. And a **mother**. And an aspiring #kitlit **writer**. And a **runner**. And a **music** lover. And an occasional **ukulele** student. And an eclectic **reader**. And an overzealous **baker**. And a ridiculously slow **knitter**.

But, this site is mostly about my development life and _(as of late)_ writing life.
