<div markdown="1">
<p>Joni Halabi is a Senior Web Manager at Georgetown University and conference speaker who writes code and technical articles, as well as a blog focusing on her life and journey to becoming a mother. When she isn’t busy writing poignant stories for families and children, she enjoys running, doing yoga, reading, listening to podcasts, and seeing live music near her home in the Washington, D.C. area. <em>Sweet Little You</em> is her debut picture book.</p>

<p>An endearing new picture book lovingly shares a unique story of a mother with a dream of having a child who makes her wish come true by having a baby on her own. Tenderly written with beautiful painterly illustrations by <a href="https://www.lisawee12.com/">Lisa Wee</a>, <em>Sweet Little You</em> is a loving and unique story about a different path to becoming a family.</p>
<p>In this tender affirmation, the story’s new mother pens a love letter to her baby of how her child came to be and how she cherishes their little family of two. A precious and rhyming text shares the mother’s promise to help them dream, explore, and find adventure in life.</p>
<p>Evocative of beloved classics such as <em>Guess How Much I Love You</em>, <em>Pat the Bunny</em>, and <em>Love You Forever</em> yet with a contemporary and diverse variation, <em>Sweet Little You</em> is for all of the intentional single parents who haven’t seen their own type of chosen family represented in a picture book that they can share with their child. The poignant story’s stirring and loving message is perfect as an affirming everyday read-aloud and also as a thoughtful and heartfelt gift for special occasions and milestones such as baby showers, new baby, birthdays, Mother’s Day, and Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p><em>Sweet Little You</em> is written for ages 0 through 5 and intended for all families.</p>
