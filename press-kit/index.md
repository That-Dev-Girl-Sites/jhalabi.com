An endearing new picture book lovingly shares a unique story of a mother with a dream of having a child who makes her wish come true by having a baby on her own. Tenderly written with beautiful painterly illustrations by [Lisa Wee](https://www.lisawee12.com/), _Sweet Little You_ is a loving and unique story about a different path to becoming a family.

In this tender affirmation, the story’s new mother pens a love letter to her baby of how her child came to be and how she cherishes their little family of two. A precious and rhyming text shares the mother’s promise to help them dream, explore, and find adventure in life.

Evocative of beloved classics such as _Guess How Much I Love You_, _Pat the Bunny_, and _Love You Forever_ yet with a contemporary and diverse variation, _Sweet Little You_ is for all of the intentional single parents who haven’t seen their own type of chosen family represented in a picture book that they can share with their child. The poignant story’s stirring and loving message is perfect as an affirming everyday read-aloud and also as a thoughtful and heartfelt gift for special occasions and milestones such as baby showers, new baby, birthdays, Mother’s Day, and Valentine’s Day.

_Sweet Little You_ is written for ages 0 through 5 and intended for all families.
