# Joni Halabi: Personal web site

This GitHub repository houses my personal website, featuring my web development work, book, and other miscellaneous writing. 

This site is built in Eleventy.


## Local development

`npm start`

That's it!


## Visual Identity

### Fonts

I am keeping the fonts simple here. All of the text uses one font, [PT Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Mono).

Social media and other icons are from a self-hosted icon font pack from [RemixIcon](https://remixicon.com/).

### Colors

This site's [color palette](https://coolors.co/3a182e-c5c5c5-829191-c95d63-f08700) consists of the following colors:

* Dark Purple: `#3a182e`
