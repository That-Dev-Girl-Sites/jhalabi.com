Hi there! I love hearing from people, but my days are pretty full between developing, parenting, and writing. Please reach out anyway, but it may take a few days (or weeks) for me to reply. ðŸ˜€

* {:.contact-ifs} **If you want to chat about development:** I am all ears! I spend most of my time with WordPress, but love to talk about anything techie.
* {:.contact-ifs} **If you want to chat about my book:** [_Sweet Little You_](/book/) is available wherever books are sold _(and in several libraries!_). I am always happy to talk about my book and am available for author visits and readings.
* {:.contact-ifs} **If you have parenting questions:** So do I.
