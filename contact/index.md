I love hearing from people and talking tech. However — to put it bluntly — I have a very active kid. And a full time gig. And a kid (who has attained "big girl" status). And a [book](/book) that I'm promoting. Did I mention my big girl?

Regardless, please don't let this scare you off from sending me a message. Replies might just take a bit longer than expected. Let's chat!
