I got an email from WordPress.org today.

> We are writing to inform you that your WordPress.org and Slack accounts have been unblocked following a recent review. This review was conducted as part of our continuous efforts to maintain a healthy and inclusive community where everyone is treated fairly and can engage positively.

I laughed. My WordPress Slack account was blocked in October 2024. Despite the fact that I almost exclusively lurked in that Slack, sending the occasional private message, I know what I did. I clicked a "thumbs-down" emoji as a reaction to one of Matt's messages.

Which one? I honestly do not remember, but it could have been any number of messages. For nearly a year, so many of them have been un-hinged nonsense. So, for the sake of guessing, it was something he posted last October.

## What I learned from being banned

Nothing.

Ok, that's not entirely true. What is true is that I did not care. I did send WordPress an email to ask what happened, solely because I was in the middle of a DM conversation with someone and the ban interrupted us. Otherwise, who cares? I deleted that workspace from my Slack app and forgot about the whole thing. That is, until today's email.

Let's get back to what I _learned_. I learned that I do not care about WordPress. At least, not as a technology. It is true that I spent years of my career developing plugins, themes, and conference talks about WordPress. It is also true that, years ago, I started a conversation on a former web team to evaluate other CMS's for our very large portfolio of websites. In the end, we migrated hundreds of our websites to WordPress. 

Right now, I happen to be at a turning point in my career, transitioning from a developer to a content creator who happens to know how to write code. That decision has absolutely nothing to do with WordPress, but the combination of this second career and my ban from WordPress made me realize something important.

**The platform does not matter.**

WordPress, and realistically any other CMS out there, is a means to an end. Over the course of my career thus far, I have worked with many different platforms. And, at many times, WordPress was the best choice.

## Choices

However, WordPress was _and is_ not the _only_ choice. It may be the best (and perhaps only) choice for many people, but it is inconsequential to me. In my new career path, I am researching and writing stories. I am making content engaging, readable, and accessible. I can do that _anywhere_. 

**The platform does not matter.**

As a developer – even as a WordPress developer – I have the basic skills to create web content on platforms that are not WordPress. I can choose another CMS. I can create a static site. _This_ site is not even on WordPress.[^1]

I can research, write, and engage on any platform. That is a privilege I have. That privilege lets me critically think about whether or not I care about WordPress as a platform, and I can honestly say I do not. You may feel differently, and that is great! We need people to care about different things – tech stacks, platforms, or whatever. But, I am the type of person who prefers a drama-free life and, I am so sorry, but WordPress is not that right now.

So, thank you WordPress for unblocking me, but it never really mattered anyway.
