excerpt: Burnout is real, especially as a modern developer.
---

Last year, I decided to write more and, for a time, I succeeded. I wrote more blog posts. Poetry. Short story drafts. Conference talks. I engaged more on social media. I even was a guest speaker on a couple of podcasts. It was fantastic.

Then I suddenly went dark. Not on purpose, but all at once, all of my creative energy left my body.

My to-do list is full of hopeful ambitions that are continually pushed to the back of the priority list. The note "finish blog article" has been on that list for months. _(Note: This is not the blog article I meant to finish.)_ 

[Burnout](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/burnout-symptoms-signs), as defined by WebMD, is "a form of exhaustion caused by constantly feeling swamped." 

That sounds about right. Ignoring the fact that I have a child (and, believe it or not, a life) outside of work, I am expected to do a lot as a developer:

* Write code
* Review code
* Keep up with the latest standards of all of the languages I write in, because it all changes minute-to-minute, and yes, "languages" is plural, because as a modern developer, I rarely if ever write in just one language
* Keep up to date with the latest libraries available in my chosen languages, because how dare I work in an outdated library, even if that library was the new hotness last month
* Ignore all new technology while I am at work, because working with the most up-to-date technology is too risky to use in production
* Simultaneously, work on a side project using the latest and greatest tech, because I need to stay relevant if I want to network with other developers or speak at conferences

I am burnt-out simply reading that list. 

Meanwhile, I remember learning how to program my first language from a physical book. _(For the curious, it was [Applesoft BASIC on an Apple iiC](https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/Apple%20II%20Documentation%20Project/Software/Languages/Applesoft%20BASIC/Manuals/Applesoft%20II%20BASIC%20Programming%20Reference%20Manual.pdf))_

I am both a creative and technical person. I became a developer because I can create with code. In the early days of programming, this was remarkably easy _(even though few people thought that at the time)_. You worried less about standards[^1] and more about the actual thing you were making. 

In modern programming, languages move too fast.[^2] I spend way too much time "keeping up" with standards and languages and not enough time creating the actual idea. The constant worry about technical upkeep comes at a cost. I pay with creative energy. 

Is this cost worth it? I am no longer convinced it is.
