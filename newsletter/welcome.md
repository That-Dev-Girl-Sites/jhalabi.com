Thank you so much for subscribing! You can expect news about my writing and [_Sweet Little You_](/book), web development tips _(and the occasional rant)_, single-parenting adventures, and, just maybe, a cookie recipe or two.

I hate spam as much as you do. I pinky-swear promise that your e-mail will _only_ be used for sending out this newsletter and you can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email.

Stay tuned for the first issue!
